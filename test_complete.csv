Hello my name is STUDENT_NAME and I think doing community service is a good idea, but I think others will disagree with it. So I think we should do an assembly on how important it is to keep our planet and city clean and educated. We should have guess speakers, reward assemblies and more disappline assemblies for the students that won't do the community service. So the students can help with the community instead of destroying it with graffiti, rival gangs, and destroying public property.

But if you take that away from them there going to have nothing and they wont be looking forward to going to school. And they may feel that they are not good in any thing but sports; and it motivates you to be better in school it teaches you how to cooperate with other student , how to be a good leader/captain, and many more.

Our positive attitude is what makes our dream come through. Positive attitude attracts wherever you want to do. For instance, working as a bartender is a great opputtunity to earn rewards.

Many people today likes give advises to others, sometimes about their life, work or personal relationship. But the question now is, ''Example is not the main thing in influencing others; is the only thing? I think it is, for two main reasons.

Fistly, When you talk to others, you sometimes gives a example about other people experiences. For example, someone who was a bad person in the past and now he change. You can change bad relations or yourself . You are influencing that person with reasons, examples and actions, he can change himself. If he wants.

Second, always we influenced people with reasons, maybe bad reasons or good reasons but is the only way to influence others. Influence people is not easy, you need to be prepared with the examples they need to ear.

I agree with this statement because what i think a first impression is that it's your first time presenting yourself to people for the first time. Those people who you are present yourself too, are getting to know you for the first time.

During the interview the person was asking me question and I answered the questions politely and after the interview i got a grade for it.

I write this letter to you because children are not suppose to perform community service. so sometimes children have time to do community service, and some don't have time to do it. For me I rather kids not doing community service because maybe they have better thing's to do. first of all, that kids have to do homework and important projects. secondly, children have the choice to do community service. finally, children have to do chores at home or help mom do something important.

first of all, kids have to do homework and important projects and that's because they have final project for the quarter, but you have to do community service what do you rather do i rather do my project for the quarter. Also homework is a important thing in your school grade and you also have to another community service again, and it is important too and that's why children are not suppose to take community service it take away to much time from important things like family, class work, and projects.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,2.7426095,2.6840527,2.8879678,2.7071471,2.744028,2.8058095,3.1916416,3.0801523,3.4276617,3.2619755,2.367578,2.8007097,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.0,181,8,0.4530386740331492,22.625,2,2,"{'homework', 'mom'}"

think high school offer those programs to young students that wants to graduate in early age and other students take this programs, because they want to graduate to continue with college or work to help their families. In other cases students just took these courses because they don't likes school .

But however their are always students that decide to complete high school in four years to have full credits to go at the best colleges. These students that take high school in four years are more prepared to colleges and they have more probabilities to get a better job.

For me take school in three years is a bad choice, because you learn a few less.

Examples:If you take school in three years and if you don't have the result that you wanted than you are gonna think that was a bad choice in your life.

Conclusion: students would take the traditional four years of school and enjoy the young age at school. Than after the four regular years, It's time to think about what they want to do with life work or continue with college.

Another example will be if you are out of town and you still need to get work your done , the perfect way will be doing it online. Lets say if I wanna study at home and do my work it will be better I will get my work done , wouldnt be distracting at all and feel much conformable in my opinion others might think it is better to go to school.

Being honest is a good choice because it is over to get easily without lying and worrying about it later on about it and what you did. Lying about something you did do could get you to make the person believe that they aren't your friend or aren't special to you but telling to truth means that they can also tell honesty and how loyal you are.

Lying would make it hard for you in your life (future) and the people who care a lot for you because they wouldn't trust you ever again or talk to you. It'll make it harder for you to communicate with them when you see them or try to talk. Later on your life lying would make you regret what you did and why you did it because you'll lose someone in your life as well as the person you love.

Influencing others.

Argument:

Influence is a big word. It has a lot of meanings. It has a lot of ways to describe.

Position:

Mi position is negative for the word influence. It gets othes in wrong ways. It is the word that convince othes to do somthing.

For example:

Somebody offer you some beer, wine, or drugs that are bad influence. If a friend say to you, hey come on lets stole that bicicle it's a bad influence. I now some people that they copy the stile life from others that is not right, so that is the bad influence. Infuence is when somebody buys things that are not health, like Mc donal's, red bulls or chips those are bad influence for you.

Conclusion:

In my conclusion I think that influencing others is not good because it to force many people to do several things wrong. It convince many children to go throught bad ways. However, the word influence can be exellent too. It can describes many things that can be good in your work or in your life.

So i think the students should have a community service. The principal should required the students to have a community service. If students would decide to have community service they would do a awesome job by helping out residents and helping out the environment because your helping it out by not letting that much trash get in to our world. You would help the plants by letting them grow more and live more. Then will have much more food and vegetables. So i think having a community service is good so will help out the environment to stay clean and have a better and cleaner community.

Experts may know more about life's important matters than most people. They might've learned from experience or studied others, a class of sociology. They know if something is wrong with the person, if they had a bad day, and if they had sleep.

My first reason why is because the majority people around world learn and comprehend better when they have an example in front them. In addition it is easier to influence others by your behavior becuase you experience it everyday and it would be very easy to set an example.

My second reason is setting examples makes you a leader and when other people start to notice it they will strive to act upon that action because they where influenced and want to become a leader like you,soon more and more people will start doing it.

There is only one con and that is depending on the individual and situation that person might not be good at making self behavior examples because they may have not experienced it before but there is a solution for this problem. You can ask a smart adult and act upon there actions and carry it on. Nobody is perfect and its okay to ask for help sometimes.

In my opinion, I think that people should seek guidance form experts and authorities, for many reasons this solution has prove to be effective, if a person listens to other people opinions, then the decision the person makes will not be base only on his/her opinion.

First, lets say if a male person seek guidance from experts and authorities when taking a decision, it shows that he is obedient and he will not act recklessly when taking a decision about his life, it shows that he is willing to listen to other people perspectives.

Second, in my opinion i think that asking for guidance shows matureness, it shows that you care about yourself and others opinion, it also shows wiseness when you ask others for guidance first so you can decide and make the best decision.

In addition to this statement the reason why the first impression is impossible is because the people did not met each other more than once they do not know their habits what they like about each other or what they do in their daily life or what they like to do like their expeirence.

Regular high school is 4 years 9,10,11,12 grade for graduate. But students can graduate and 3 years some school has a programs that allow high school to graduate in three years,

this programas has three opcion for gradute in three years. The first opcion is summer school the scond opcion is evenings school and the last opcion is do not take any elective courses.

My first reason, why i think is better finish high school in three years for students is because all of the students high school are teenager and they need time for do stuff. So why i think is good idea finish high school in three years is because they could be take drive licenses, insurance, all stuff they need.

My second reason, is because all of the students are teenager, and some working for save money for college. If they can finish high school and three years they can working one year and same money for collage.

My third reason is because all the students who follow this programs could be more opcion for find a good college , and find a good place for live close of the family and find a good job.

Their parents work day and night if they got out of high school with a diploma they will be able to work full time and help their parents with money or even move out of the house and start living independently, another reason is that teenagers would be more mature for their ages and learn everything they need to know to be successful in life.

Nowadays employees are looking for young adults to work for them but also with experience, that means if students graduates in three years they could gain experience by working on a restaurant,store et in one year. Other teenagers will go to college or university if they know what they want to study and know what they want to be, they will graduate at a good age not young, but not that old,they would have more time, energy, and interest.

I witnessed one day a new kid came to my school with attitude he was giving out everyone what they want like many people asked him where he was coming from he said ""I'm coming from

New York"". He genially answer their question with respect and calmness like one kid asked how old are you, He replied saying that ""I'm 14 years old"" Even though

Some kids were being rude to him some of them even try to bully him,but cause of his attuide no one couldn't do much. He had no problem talking with teachers and other kids cause he wasn't feeling shy to talk with them he was happy and he was making an eye contact with everyone he's talking with. The kid probably had fun he made new friends earlier than other kids that were new. So that's why having a attitude not always means bad.

I think students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school, because student should think in their future wild there in high school because they can start to get ready to University or college to choose what career they would like to study.

I think student can start thinking in what kind of career they want to study in high school at a young age because is important to students to known what career they want to story after finishing high school.

in some societies,students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school because they can select a specific guide to help study better for your career.

However; other said that young boy don,t have to worry about any career wild there in high school because they still younger, but otherwise i think is a good idea to start thinking in college when you are in high school because is important for kids to known what career they want.",3.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.7348256,2.679504,2.8639174,2.7012086,2.6528318,2.7353046,2.40079,2.4014807,2.736115,2.1981332,2.136795,2.7662625,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,235,6,0.4340425531914894,39.16666666666666,0,0,set()

Imagination you can think about what to choose like if there is a car you like imagen if you didint choose the other one that one is going to the dumster if was one good car and one ugly car but if it was knowledge you will have pressure. You will not know what to pick or you will know what to pick if you use your imagination. Knowledge you really have to decide what you want but imagination you just can imagen like what are you going to need that in your life like if you had to choose a house or a car what will you need more in life thats why you use your imagination so i rather pick a house beacus you will need that house when you grow up like for your kids. knowledge i feel its bad for you in the futcher.

CEC6870D564F,"Hi, These is Generic_Name. In my opinion is a good idea the school allowing students to have and use cell phones in classrooms.

First, at all student can use cell phone for any emergency or use the Google translation because sometimes is take minutes to find out in the dictionary. Also, because in some schools Student can't have access to use computer.

Second, Sometimes teachers put some worksheet or order tints to do in Google classroom and we have to do by using a computer and sometimes computer gate very slow and we can do by use cell phone device is sly.

Third. We know some student use cell phone for bad propose like to no't pay attention in class or make bulling other classmate. But, I think if the Schools use different methods like to block some app for example Snapshot or other student use to bulling.

finally, It's convenient to use cell phone in class special wen the teacher is to busy and we can use the cell phone to gate information about math or any other class.

In conclusion,

base in that is necessary to use a cell phone for any emergency. We can finding word that we don't known by using Google translation. It is good to use cell phone for education purposes.

For example, lets say your mate wants you to meet his or her parents, so to give them a good impression you would have to, have a good attitude tours everything they say in order to give a good impression to them. another example can be work, having a good attitude at work can be a lot less stressful and more positive in your life and others coworkers because your not complaining of how difficult your day was, they have it difficult too, but maybe not having so much stress in your mind or complaining how life is treats you, you can even hang out with your friends or your coworkers time to time and make new friends or people like you even little more because at the end of the day everything would still be the same so be more positive.

I choose working in group because you can task for help when it's needed. If you get stuck, you could ask your partner for help. If you done understand something , you could ask your partner for help. If you got question you could ask your partner also. If you don't know what to do you could ask your partner.

Working alone could be confusing at time. Working alone could be hard and have no help. If you got a question you have no one to ask. Also if you get stuck it could be hard to get back in track. Working alone could get stressful. Working alone is not easy, you gotta think harder.

Working in groups can be easy. Working with a partner could finish up quick. You guys could talk about it. One could be drawing while the other one could be writing.

Positive attitude is the right choice it's like a no brainer. Also you will be happy, like who dosen't like to be happy. Finally positive attitude will bring success to your life and the people around you.

another reason success is great good things will happen around you even if you don't suspect it. Success will get you to wherever you want to be, but you have to be positive. If your positive, and a teenager you could nail your first interview you just got to be positive.

Final reason is be your self it's so important because being unique means your special and something good will happen to you in life. People will love who you are when you are yourself ,and get real friends who will help you. Don't be like everybody trying to be the same like every body.

I think people ask multiple people because the person who is asking for advice wants the most advice and best information and opinions from others. Another reason why someone might ask multiple for advice is that everybody has different experiences throughout their lifetime and might know more stuff because of those experiences throughout their lifetime. People might ask the elderly for advice because their wise and have lived a long life so they might know alot of information to pass on. Everybody has different opinions but hearing different opinions from others can help you make a better choice. I think you should ask your parents for advice first before you ask anybody else for advice because your parents are the one the ones who raised you and they know what's best for you. For example your parents probably told you when you were little to not to talk to strangers because they know its the best for you.

First, in my case if I see a beautiful girl, I start getting in love of that girl and having good impression about her, but may be I see something wrong that i don't like of her, I start changing my good impression that i had of her.

Second, when somebody watch YouTube videos, then that person person watch a publicity about the new amazing iPhone 11, he has good impression about the amazing iPhone 11, but when he buys the iPhone, he looks that the battery is not that good as he thought, so he change his opinion.

Third when I go to fancy restaurants, I see a lot of delicious food coming throw the tables, I have good impression and expectation about the restaurant, and I think that the food is delicious, but when I try to eat one of those plates, the food was disgusting and it didn't taste that delicious as it looks,that's because my impression change totally.

The first reason why I dissagree with this statement is because we can not judge on other people from the first sight. Meeting someone and talking to them dose not mean that you know them yet. Some people treat others with different way. For example, if you are close to me and we know each other for long time, I will treat you different than a person who I just met.

The second reason why I dissagree with this statment is because we do not know what other people going through. If you met a person for the first time and this person was rude or aggressive, there should be a reason for this behaviour. Maybe the person had a bad day or perhaps he is going through rough situations. You should think about what you are going to do if you were in the same position. That is why I dissagree with the statement.

In conclusion, I'm against the statement that says the first impressions are almost impossible to change because we should know the person well before we think about any impression.

CAA2C4C4E79C,"Do you think first impressions are impossible to change? Some people say that first impressions are possible to change by getting more in detail. I agree that first impression are impossible to change because first impressions are negative and peoples thoughts don't change.

In other words, first impressions are usually negative. For example, if you see a person and he or she just has a serious face, your first impression ""that person has bad vibes''. Or a type of food that looks strange to you, you automatically start saying negative things about it.

Also, peoples thoughts never seem to really change you will always see that character or thing the same way. Why? Because nothing changes everything it remains if something does change ,it changes in negative way. As an example, people get more cruel or companies start inventing products that shouldn't be together. Your mind won't change unless that person ,place or thing changes in a positive way.

So, first impressions are almost impossible to change. First impressions can change by getting more involved and finding more information about that subject but, it is impossible to change that. In the futures lets hope this world and the people and objects in it will change in a postive way so our first impressions can be possible to change.

First of all,the students will get home late. The students won't have have time to do after school sports nor activities. The kids will not have time to do homework nor study. The students won't have time to do fun things on their own time.

Additionally,the school will need to spend more money on students. The state will need to raise taxes for the schools. The school will need to spend more money on bills for utility. The schools will need to spend more money on supplies and food for kids.

Finally,the students will be more exhausted. The students will be exhausted because they will need to do work for extra hours. Students who do after school sports or activities will not get enough sleep because they will be getting home late. The students will get home past there bed time and they have to eat dinner.

Another reason why Robotics is a job for me to pursue, because it's all about coding. Furthermore, coding is basically you have to type in the words specifically. For example, Forward = (1). That means it tells the robot to move forward only one time. Also, coding is like math, you have to calculate what distance is the Robot is going to do and where it want to stop.

Another reason why Robotics is the one thing that I'd like to pursue is Building. Building the Robot is where you have to work with a team to make it happen, if you were to build it by yourself, it would take a long time to make, since it's only you and not 3 or 4 people helping you. Building is like Lego, but you have to screw in nuts, and not connecting them together like plastic bricks. Also, building the robot is most important, because if you screw something up, you have to remove every part of the robot to fix that one mistake you did.

Although student get to proud and tend to over do the work, giving the student praise always comes out to be better than what they actually expected to achieve. Giving students praise always makes students feel good. Praising students who fail always has a different outcome the second time they do the task been giving.

Giving the students praise always comes out to be better than what they were expecting;for example,a student who was doing bad before you praised them realized what the purpose of the work was and put all their effort into the work. Therefore, the work being produced was very productive.

Praising a student builds their self esteem by making them feel good about the work that has been done. Which means if they feel very good and proud of the work thats been done the work that will be produce will be very creative and outstanding.

Praising students who produce deficient work encourages them to produce better the next time work is been given to them. Therefore,the student knows that someone is always there to encourage them when needed.

they will find you setting a good example or showing good behavior. Not only setting a good example can make people say you're a good person , it can also lead to ""good karma"".

Lets say you have a younger sibling, and they want to be like you , you can be smart , responsible,and a good behaving person, show them a good example so they can be as successful as you. same goes to people dont show them a bad behavior or example, thats not gonna get you anywhere, that'll only make people not like you and assume different things. Another thing is always set good example when you're out in public with a family member, because if you dont people will not like that and have your family at fault.

in conclusion to all this if you show good behavior or set a good example by showing it , It will not only make people assume you're a good person it will also influence young ones to do the same.

B49D86AC2062,"Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm? its a 50% chance you will be successful,reason for this is that some people give up too easily,some people get tired of failing and failing again. You dont need to fail many times before you get successful.

Some people never put in work to be successful as they are today some just became successful out the cut. Right now the world we live in you dont really need to put in alot of effort,there are many ways of being successful for example we have social media! Social media now has a big impact in the world we live in.

Scientists are perfect examples of this statement. A scientist can start an experiment and fail over and over again till they get they expected the results. Students can fail a test over and over again but whiles he's failing hes learning from his mistakes to pass his test.

Working on something new or getting used to something new,you wont get it right the first time you would mess up or fail but once you keep getting used to it you learn from your mistake which helps you to become successful.

If you ask most successful people of today,some might respond by saying they experienced alot of failure on the way to the top some might respond with a no,this states that failure might plays a role in being successful it may also not play a role in being successful.

When you are trying to accomplish things and make friends, it can get you hated. First off when you open up to people and be honest with them, they aren't going to like it and turn on you and hate you. when they see you succeeding and doing better than they are, they will talk about you because they arent where you are and they will make you try to feel down and unsuccessful.

When trying to do good things in life people will down really low to the point where you give up, and just try to fit in and do bad thing that could lead you down a wrong path, to where you can end up in prison or dead you can end up in the wrong crowd, when you thought they were good people. They will manipulate you at first thinking they are good people and want to see you accomplish being thing in life. Once you get to know them and see who they really are you will see the complete opposite and it could be too late to turn back.

In conclusion whether you try to be your self and accomplish your goal there will always be people who will hate you and bring you down with them.

BFB53ACD3DD5,"Have you asked to your-self what might people think about you or what impressions they have about you? That's a hard question to answer, but I guess everybody does it. First impressions not always are positive for our-selfs, it can make you doubt about your-self, look for people's approval, and get a low-esteem. First impression not always come into your life with good intentions.

As first point, first impressions make you overthink what to do and what to say, making you doubt about your-self, and loosing your confidence. Nobody should wonder what others think about them, because each person have their own life and their own problems.

In high schools, mostly the 90% of students look for the approval of their friends. Teenagers are the most affected. Essentially, this teenageers do not have their own life.

In facts, first impressions affect all people but mostly the teenagers. They get a low-esteem, all because the system in what now we life, first impressions.

I remember my first year of high school, I was afraid like a little chicken as we said in my country with no idea what to do or what to say, wonderig what they were thniking about me.

No one is perfect, people make mistakes all the time is a part of being human. From my past experience i've left multiple impressions on people, ""ya people maybe nieve nor stubborn to pay attention to things they want see"". Especailly at a job interview your probably won't ready, alarm didn't work, and 5 minutes late, the manager is think that your a lazy person that doesn't deserve it, but you meet all the requirements for the job. Then can see what your really made of. You may meet people on a bad day and they seem angry that doesn't define a person. People can change so others can as well. People can be blunt off the first impression and every time they you thats the first thing that comes to mind, but you always change the way they think of you. It might take minutes,hours,days,months, or maybe years, but people will always try again and again to get the satistfaction needed. When people are motivated they can do anything.

Overall online school is a great tool for students that may struggle to attend school. Once its issues are met and something has being done online school may not be only a great tool for some scholars but also an opportunity to finish school without any issues.

If the advices were not helping out so much then i would just ask the teacher and the teacher should give you a lot of helpful advices because there the ones that are teaching the class so they should know what to do to help a student out.

Also the reason why people ask multiple persons for advice is because. if you ask one person for advice that person may not give you a lot of advices than asking multiple people for advices because the advices that other people are giving you can help you out more than that one advice that the one person gave you.

Asking multiple people for advice can teach you new things that you didnt know of. Asking multiple people for advice can help you in so many ways. Asking multiple people for advice make you help someone one day that needs advices in problems.

In some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter to high school, but the big question here is: Do you think is a good idea for students to commit to a career to a young age?

To commit to a career at a young age is a good idea for students, who are interested to study a long career, for example: Doctors, pediatric, layer, teachers, etc. If students start to study this careers at a young age, they will be a great future for this country.

Also if students start to study at young age they will have more opportunities to continue with their careers, for example; if a teaher wants to start a new career, they can do it because he is young and has the capcity to continue.

First i want you to know that is a good thing that you thing of that but if students don't want to help and you sent them do something i think they are going to make it worst. EX: you sent them to go pick up trash and they go and they are just playing around they are going to be fighting with the trash throwing it where it was clean then later when they finish playing they are going to see a mess that they are going to get lazy and just walk away and go to another place where its cleaner and if they are trouble makers they are going to do that over and over again.

Think about it if you let students that really want to help out and they do the same thing (throw the trash to each other) and if they really want to help out they are going to clean for them selves. and they are going to be helping because they want to ,not because you forced them to do community service.

I was also thinking of you giving 2 choices

2*students get to do extra home work for their hardest classes(where they are almost flunking the class)................ come on unlist think about it.

Thats why practicing is important.

Having fun while playing in band or orchestra your able to travel to diffrent states to learn how difrrent groups play,

learn diffrent songs, and learn the sites of that certain city. Thats why I joined orchestra when I was about 9-10years old I learned about 20 new songs that 1 school year and I loved doing it. It was fun to watch, and hear them while playig it was probably the best year i had in 3rd grade.

The people in your group are like your family you guys are going to travel together and perform together. And even making freinds to the new kids who join later in the year so dont worry about being left out while traveling to that certain state your always going have someone to talk to be around.

One enjoyable way to spend time outdoors is by playing sports. I say this because everybody loves playing sports both girls and boys like to play sports. People can choose to play soccer, basketball, baseball, or golf. These activities are enjoyable because people like to be active and when their active they play sports they go outside to play sports. They can play in competition or just scoring points whichever way is best to have fun.

Another enjoyable way to spend time outdoors is going to a pool. I say this because people like to swim when it's hot outside to cool them down a little. People can go to a community pool for people who know how to swim and for people who don't know how to swim. The people at the community pool can teach others how to swim but it's gonna cost some money but its worth it. I say this is enjoyable because people like to have fun in the pool especially if it's during the summer . People can swim and play volleyball or play catch while in the pool to have fun.

First reason is there a lot of people in the world who has a lot of problems. so I think that this quote would light up there day and make them fell better. second reason is that people that dose not have any problems could save this quote in there brains and when they are facing a problem they could use it to help them through that time and to do better. lastly I think when Duke Ellington was going through trough times he used his own straghe to help him to do his best and not give up.

Next reason why you should agree with Duke Ellington is that when people have a lot of problems most of them just give up for example most people dose not have enough money to pay there bills some sell their house while others sell the cars and most people become homeless and live in the streets but if the hear this quote it might help them not to give up and do there best.

My final reason why everyone should agree with Duke Ellington quote is it's hard going through a problem because any thing can happen some people lose there jobs because of a problem.

In conclusion I think that everyone should agree with Duke Ellington's quote because it can help you not give up when you are going through a problem.

Also some people might says that cell phones can effect students study and their grades in school, and it is not a good thing for students to having their cell phones in classroom.

However, not everyone agrees with this position,because cell phones can effect students health such as eyes problems if students look at it for a long time. And it can get students interest about games or social media or app for chatting. Additionally, there might be support for this idea that cell phones can help students to search on things or information that they are looking for in class. Also cell phones can help students easily to contact with their friends at school or to call their parents in an emergency situations.

Ultimately, this argument cannot stand because cell phones can effect students scores, students might be missing something important in the class while playing with cellphones. It seems like nothing but cellphones can destroy students future. The reason this idea is fallible that students cannot focus on class if they are using cell phones in the classroom.

Given these points, students might be get addicted to cell phones and cell phones will became a bad habit for students.

If I would have chosen this offer, I would have 3 reason why I agree that offer. Student should always think first if a school offers you something.

My first reason is, student can take their time in the morning to wake up and take a shower. For example, if a student wakes up late to school, that student wouldn't have time to do stuff he/she planned in the morning. But online school, that student can wake up late and take their time what he/she planned in the morning. My second reason is that its less cheaper. In online school, students only need: a computer, notebook, and something to write with. Students also receive free food from their home. But in regular school, some student pay money to get food, and the supplies for each class can be expensive. My last reason is student sometime finish their online school early, and have the rest of the day to play games, or hang out with friends.

In conclusion, student should always pick the right decision, when it comes to a offer in school. I think online school is good for students.

Where i would like to visit

My opinion about this change is a good idea. But also many students have a grade of a (C) or lower it would not be a good idea changing the policy sport grade for those students. For others this policy my be a good idea because that way students that love sport's can start doing much better in school and have better grades. A, (B) or higher is a good grade so that way they can play a sport they like.

Teachers would probably accept this policy so that way their students will pay more attention. This change would not effect much but for students who don't study this idea might not be good, and might fill bad because they love sport's but can't play them for having to not pay attention or do your work at home.

Instead we should vote to see if we like this policy or not so we wont have to pass thru all this stuff of the policy changing. A fact about students here in SCHOOL_NAME would choose not to accept this new school policy because the old policy is u can't have more than three (F) and i would say the old policy is better than the new one our principal want to change it to.

Although some people experienced the situation. The advice might be useful for other people too. It can help them agree with the choice or decision they will make.

One reason why some people might ask more than one person for advice is people might have different views of the situation. Some people will have an idea of what to do and some people won't. Some people might tell you to do wrong things. Some people might not know what your going through therefore they will give you bad advice. Some people will know what they are doing so they will give you good advice.

Secondly why people ask more than one person is some people have experienced it or gone through it. They might know what will happen. They might know what you will see and go though during the experience because they probably gone through it.

Finally why people ask more than one person is to make sure that their doing it right or successfully. To make sure that they know what they are doing. To ask their opinions to see if they are thing as you are. To see if you agree with them. They might have a lot in common with with about the situation.

3E4B70F8555C,"The benefits of working with a group or working alone. Which do you feel is more beneficial.

In my opinion, I believe working with a group is more beneficial because a group creates different ideas, team work to win the competition, and entertain the audience.

First, each person of the group has a different thoughts and different ideas. They share their ideas to create incurable, different, complete thoughts as a group. Some of the ideas are very difficult to reach the goal, but it is passable to think together and make it happen.

Team work to win the competition is to work together. Each person has to play a different correcter's and roles. Some of them in the group they have to support the main correcter in the stage or back of the stage. Rehearse time to make it inconvenient to be with family members to reach their accomplishment.

Finally, entertaining the audience is most important to each group member. An audience is the people come to enjoy the show, each of the group member are work hard to convince and entertain the audience. Each group member has one leader to follow their roles in specific time to make the show more interact.

I think, the wonderful job can be done working together as a team, developing their ideas and creating entertainment in their performances . And, also, their task is to gives the fans happiness and good time. Team members, families, and teachers will feel proud. I think working with a group it is more joyful.

People should make there own decisions, Because, As a self reliant person, making a decision based on someone else's advise can be very risky. For example, buying an insurance plan, going based in someone else's coverage will cover something you dont need, while if chosen based on your needs there wouldnt be a problem.

Self reliance is very important for person to become independent. If one dose not trust themselves how will they grow. for example, A famous quote by Micheal Jordan say's ""You miss 100% of the shots you dont take"". this quote eludes to the fact that as an individual it is important to have self confidence in their decision making, because if you dont take a risk in making your own decision you will 100% miss the shot's you take.

Furthermore Making o's own decisions are important ,because, People will not always be there, and you will be forced to make your own decisions. For example choosing your own apartment isnt anybodies else's job but yours. Choosing an apartment is very important and one must have self reliance in order to make the right decision for them selves.

If you are passioned, you will be better at everything that you do, also, we have to be passioned to look for new stuff that you will like to know more about and learn about it.

If you want to grow in life , you can't be scared,

72A69C1B34A8,"I think students should have the opportunity to choose their own classes as electives rather than taking a class in the arts because if they were assigned to a class they know nothing about then that would be setting them up for failure and I do strongly believe that is not the right way to go about things especially in the school district. We cannot let the students fail because it is important to have something to look forward to when they arrive to school. It is a definite requirement for students to take classes such as music, drama, and art however, it would be fair to let them decide on their own behalf. Once a students picks the class they would hopeful and full of joy to attend to it everyday. I believe that no matter what a student can decide what they believe in and have no dought about it. The students should have the ability to be successful in school if they put their minds into it.

Although if the counclours put students in the classes they dislike in my opinion, the student will most likely not attend to the classes they were assigned to. Furthermore It would be appropriate to encourage students to choose the right fit class they would want to enroll in. I challenge you to go through with this action to let the students decide on their own.

in conclusion, given this opportunity for the students it will increase the satisfaction rate and expand on more ideas for the school in the future.

Although pleasing loved ones and being like everyone else in a collective identity can set a moral behavior or have good personal characteristics by which an individual is recognizable as a member of a group; like a sense of belonging. It also feels good when collective aspects of the communities's characteristics; like values or common interests by which something is distinctly recognizable or known and is indivisible to the individual and so you start to feel proud of your community, much like patriotism or nationalism.

But you should have the freedom to instinctively or consistently question your community if it contains fundamental errors in reasoning. For example a principle, belief, idea, or opinion of a collective or person's authority that is considered to be absolute truth is dogma. You should also be sometimes skeptical of the advice of you're friends and family members as well because they could mistakenly give you the wrong opinion about a course of action but you should still listen and have trust in them on everything else.

First of all,school prepares students to face up and go against the real world,some students may need at least one more year in school to get their mind set for their future. Staying the extra year can make the student focus more on the classes that they're taking. If students decide to only go for three years, they can forget about sports or any after school activities they want be in. They will have to put all their effort and energy into passing their after school classes.

Second of all,students can be more independent. Students learn how to manage time to do work and extra activities. Students can also learn how to be more reliable and build up their confidence on doing things on task and on time. By doing the three year only, they cant take breaks and if so the students wont have enough time to rest their bodies and be able to do what is asked.

Some may argue,that students staying for three years are going to have enough knowledge to be able to take on the real world.

I used just for fun, when i want to think about something else, I develop my drawing by be in art class.

first, everyone has a talent or skill, my talent is drawing, draw is the more relaxing thing that I experiment,For example,some people said draw, help you to make clear your ideas, distract you that make forget about your problems. make you focus in the paint.

next, I just my talent just fun,because that make relax and that help me to clear my ideas. For example some famous artist said, A artist,

for him drawing it's not a responsabilitie, or homework , art is to express all their feeeling in a paint that why I drawing just for fun because when I draw I express my problem in the paint, and that give peace, when i'm angry I draw too that make happy .

then,I decided to take art to develop my drawing,and paratices, now i know more things then before for example, the rules how are the steps, the way to made more easy, some people developing the drawing by theirself, and they want to make more experienece by theirself, that is more interesting because they experiment their own talent. the results are better.

in my personal opinion i do agree that first impressions are almost impossible to change. its impossible to change because thats the very first time you meet someone new in your life. first impressions are very important. there is no way you can change first impressions its not like we can go back in time to switch our answer. making a bad first impression can go very wrong but thats that its done and you cant go back. for example like making a first impression at a job interview like obviously making a good impression is very important if you want a job.

i can also understand why some may say ""almost impossible"" because technechly you kinda can. for example if both of you say ""can we start over"" or something like that. your always going to have that impression from the first time you guys ever meet. so really it goes both ways how someone may take it. i personal dont agree with that because it dosent sound right or feel right. some may move on and ectually forget. while others may not and mentally remmber.

inconclusion it is all based on the reader and how they take it. like i have mention i personal dont think you can change your first impression. we cant go in time and change the past. it donesnt sound reasonablie theres no real reason. some may agree with what i say some may not. then again i can kinda see how someone may want or how to change there first impression.

Second when you tell someone how much you do not care about them can make you look bad, when you have a friend that you tell stuff that you do not like about him can be hurtful, when you talk about people in front of them can not help your friendship with them, when you said hurtful things about them they will not like you any more,and how you tell people about what you do not like about them it can be harsh.

Finally when you tell people how you really feel in a different way can still be hurtful, the way you tell someone you do not like them can be more hurtful to them, when you speak of some one but in a different way can still grateful of hurtful, when you talk about someone in a nice vice but it can still be mean, and how you talk about someone is up to you no matter what you say.

Prime Minister Winston Churchill said ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"" I agree with Churchill""s statement because you have to work hard towards success and In general not everything turns out to our favor the first time so, you have to try again until you reach success.

On the other hand success does not consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. Success is gain through those who choose to succeed and you do not need to fail in order to succeed.

Working hard towards success without losing enthusiasm is important because you have to be patient and sometimes we can be inpatient so, we loss our enthusiasm we will loss interest and will no longer be motivated to succeed. Enthusiasm is strong warmth of feeling interest. Failing is alright because to succeed you are going to fail and you learn from your lesson, try again, and move on.

On the contrary side success is obtained to those who seek it. Studies show that 78.2% of people don't succeed because they chose to be comfortable and not motivate themselves. Success does not consist of failing and failing ,People should be assertive that they want to succeed so they are prepared with the mindset not to fail.

First, new ideas can help us decide something that we're not sure to decide. Guidance can explain what you want; they can tell us what is better for us or if something going to work. Guidance is really help full in life, if we didn't have guidance in our life would be a little hard for decide things. New ideas can help you decide something.

next, guidance help us when we're confused to make decision or don't know what to do. Guidance can help in our future and they help you decide witch idea is better for you and for your future. They always know what is better for us.

The other side, some people think that we should make our on decision, it make since, because it make us have responsibility and always know what we want, but what if you do the wrong decision and you can't change the decision, because you already choose it.

I was thinking about the policies you were offering about the cell phones allowed in school and I would suggest to choose policy 2 because students aren't going to follow what the first policy says. Also because student's have no reason to be texting in class if other students they are texting are in class too, students shouldn't be allowed to have phones in school because they would be distracting the rest of the class when their phone goes off in class.

If students can have phones in school it's a sure fact that they're going to be using them in class. With Policy 2 the school can take the phones away at the beginning of the school day to be sure they aren't using the phone during class.

Also with Policy 2 the students aren't able to be communicating just in case they have a test. If the phones are taken away they will reduce the chances of the students cheating on tests.

I also pick Policy 2 because students are going to be distracting the class if someone sent them a message and the phone goes of in class in the middle of a lesson. No one likes to be distracted while they are learning, or at least i know i don't. That's why there shouldn't be phones in schools. With phones the grades of the students will go down because, they aren't paying attention.

I think that is true because if you have now imagination than how are you going to get knowledge. I agree because Albert Einstein had to have a strong imagination to become really smart, Albert Einstein lived through a lot so he knows a lot, Elbert Einstein is smart.

To begin with, I think that Elbert Einstein had a strong imagination because he was one of the smartest human beings to ever live. He was really smart that is why I think he said "" imagination is more important than knowledge"" he had to have a strong imagination to think and become really smart. Elbert Einstein created and invented a lot of thing and to make to things he needed a strong imagination.

In addition, Elbert Einstein was really old and really smart so he lived through a lot as a human not as genus. He also learned a lot from being a genus but he did live through a lot and he was a human.

Also, I think that Elbert Einstein created cool inventions and gadgets from his imagination he needed a wild imagination to think and create a lot of cool things that is most likely why he said this quote. He was smart but he used his imagination too.

6886DF2A98BE,"Scientist Albert Einstein once said, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge."" I agree with what Albert Einstein said. Some people think its the other way around were knowledge is more important than imagination. imagination and knowledge could be used for a lot of things. I think that imagination is more powerful than knowledge because you can come up with many things and in order to get knowledge on something you need imagination.

Imagination is something you need to come up with things. You need to think about it first, get the things you need to create it, and then study from it. Imagination can help you a lot, You can use your imagination to your advantage, you can use it keep you busy. you can build things, draw things,and create things from your imagination. you can do many more things with your imagination. Imagination has no limits.

In order to get knowledge of something, you would need to use your imagination. You would need to take notes and study from it. you use your imagination to get knowledge. You can learn so much from your imagination and its very useful. we have to be careful with our imagination and our knowledge. Its ok to make mistakes while learning, you just have to learn from them.

In conclusion I think imagination is more important. We use out imagination every day. We learn things every day. It would be hard without imagination. Imagination can be used for a lot of things like making a cartoon show, drawing, and thinking. You can also use you imagination while you read.

First reason, why I agree on what the Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote. I think if you don't work hard for what you want,you will never accomplished it. Also believe in yourself and be confident, if you have skills use them. However, someone people have skills, but are not confident with their self. Practice or training will help you be successful.

Second reason, why I agree on what the Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote. In my experienced I wasn't confident I would be shy to present my project. Although, I got my first job and helped me a lot with my fear. Now when my teachers asks who wants to present I will raise my hand first, so I can get over it.

Lastly, why I agree on what the Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote. In my second experienced I was good at algebra and my other subjects, but my junior year I gave up when my grades dropped to a zero. In my second semester i started bringing my grades to at least a C, to make my mom proud. Until this day I feel proud of myself too.

The first reason is that we as a human being, we need help. When we are working, we need help from others at work, during class at school, anywhere where we work. For example, at work when I'm cooking I also need someone that can brings the ingredients. Some would argue that, working in group don't help you to learn, but we learn from others not from ourselves. As a result, we obtain help from others working as a group. Additionally, we obtain benefits working in groups. In addition, benefits to us are made it from others, benefits to others are made it from us. To illustrate, when I'm sick, and I can't go to work I need someone to change his scheduled, and take my place, for that day, so he is going to need the same benefit from me to cover him one day he get be sick, or will have any emergency. Some may say that working in group is not beneficial, working in a group we acquired more benefits than working alone. As a result working in groups give us the chance to have more benefits.

We do not get to choose who our family is therefore thats beyond our control. Family can influence you to either be a great person or A horrible person. For example If you grew up watching your father abuse your mother, you have a higher chance of putting your hands on females. How ever if you have kind, loving parents you have a higher chance of becoming a nice, loving person. Keep in mind we are with our family everyday so were most likely going to end up like them.

We can't choose our community either therefore its beyond our control. Personally I feel like the community we grow up in has a huge impact on our life because it determines the kind of people you grow up around. For example if you grow up in a bad neighborhood you will be around gangsters and drug dealers. As a kid you may think selling drugs is fine because you seen other older kids do it. Selling drugs is going to result in you going to jail which means your going to be around other bad people which is most likely going to have an influence on the person you become.

Others may think seeing bad should inspire you to be better but unfortunately it is not that simple. Your character is usually built over the years not over night.

In company's employer looks for positive attitude in workers, simply because they want someone who can make company more successful. If workers have positive attitude toward their job it will make them more productive in job and lead company to success.

One of the major difference is when successful businessman goes through hardships they keep positive attitude and try to execute the problem and it leads them to success and who are not successful they simply give up and gain bad attitude.

it is good to graduate early whenn you are young so you will have alot of years in college to be a heigher education. at the end i would say and support every one that want to graduate early because it is good for their future and i have to say thank you for the people that they are helping me to do that.

A22BC15DDB95,"To conserve energy and resources, some businesses have adopted four-day work week, with each day consisted of ten hours. Like other places, the energy conservation in the school is also important. To have four-day school with additional two hours, is not a good idea due many problems.

Having four-day school is a good idea, because of some advantages. By having three days off from school student will have more time to do other things such as, they can spend more time on job, sports, picnics, other courses, etc. The students will have more time to relax and the students will be mentally well prepared for coming work days. Due to this, we can also conserve large amount of energy and other resources.

On the other hand, it also has a lot of disadvantages. By having two additional hours every day the student will be tired and they have to do more work every day. As a result, the students will not able to pay attention toward learning. When you are tired you can not able to pay full attention toward studies, due to which this is useless because students will not able to learning anything. This will also effect their grades. The students that do part time job they will face problem in doing that. The students who are willing to participate in extra curriculum activities, they will not able to participate in it. These are the reason that makes it a bad idea.

Or can be other reason why they bully other people, which is people who gets bully they could kill themselves about getting bullied by other ones and thats a bad situation.

But those bad people they keep on bulling they don't stop until something happens and I ask my self why? this happens sometimes, probably its because we are different than they are or they feel more stronger than other ones or can be any other reason probably they are rich they have more money than other people, probably thats why bulling someone is not nice it could cause bad things to you.

And I understand that its hard for those people who are suffering about bulling, and its hard to support all that when you get bullied for someone, when you bullied i thin k is not for some reason and its horrible for those people who gets bullied by someone, I think thats something that those people who are bulling they should stop bulling those poor people.

Based on my experiences, I agree with Mr. Emerson. Because in order for a person to grow, that person will have to do an certen task, to help that person reach that goal or goals. There are difference things a person can grow in like: school, career, and hobbies.

In school a person learned skills to help a person in the further such as, wrighting, reading, vocabulary, history, and math etc. A person will learned, how to talk to other people, and how to act, by making friend. Also in school like, community collage, can help a person can also developing jobs skills, for further career.

Another thing you can grow in, is careers. A person can grow in their career by going up their working rank I am currently working at Searchs and I am the supervisor their. At first, I got hired as a cashier. It took me a while, but I got my way up there.

Hobbies is another thing you can grow in. People can learning and practicing skills to help them up prove their's hobbies. One of my many hobbies, is drawing. When I was six, I can only draw sticks finger. I have taken many art classes to help me develop my drawing skills. Now I can draw a human with details.

C02F3803D0D1,"People think that first impressions are almost impossible to change. I disagree with that because impressions is just what you think, always make you think different things, and you never know whats gonna happen.

Impressions is like when you thought somethings, its just what you think about someone or something. For example:My impression is that she is not telling me the truth. you think that she's not telling you the truth but you don't know the truth.

Impressions can make you think different or bad just because how you look at someone or something. For example: If you see someone that has a bad looking, your impression is that he might be poor but, you can change your impression if you see that he has the Iphone of the year, or he has a Lamborghini, so it can make you think different.

When women get pregnant they always get impress and trying to guess what the baby is gonna be. For example: When my mom got pregnant and she had me, her impression was that it was gonna be a girl, and she wanted a girl, but here i am, 18 years old, a big boy and she was impress and sad, but when she see that i was very handsome her impression change she's happy now.

Some people believe that just with their impression you are what they say.

Next time you think that the first impression is impossible to change, you have to think the first impression does not say everything about a person or something.

I hope you never impress by something or someone, that can be different that you thought, thats why we dont judge, God is the only one who can judge.",2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,2.979245,2.9033952,3.0837488,2.9816003,2.9427319,3.0049498,2.4378872,2.5057712,2.589152,2.447878,2.3537278,2.4317827,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,294,12,0.4319727891156462,24.5,8,4,"{'18', 'whats', 'mom', 'somethings'}"

Also technology is addicted to many peoples and it can cause biggest damages on their lives; for example if you use a phone for to long it can burn your eyes no in that moment but it will make you lose your vision. Also,

technology can make peoples lose their mind.

Next schools, should not be allow to use technology because students can cheat easily using the technology. they can not learn how to write by hand because technology will do everything for them. Also students can use the technology to bully other and to share inappropriate thing for example photos. However, technology distract students to their classes.

Finally, technology was reported once of the highest causes of accidents in the roads. Because people were using their phone during they were driving. Also people use technology to make frauds; for example to get in the banks accounts and get money from others peoples accounts. However, people can use to get someone personal information or to hack someone accounts.

When you give someone advice, on what not to do or what to do, they won't take you serious because you're not following your own advice. They'll see you as if you're playing around if you do the opposite of what you told them. That's why a lot of people say ""Actions speak louder than words"". There's a difference on saying things, and actually doing them.

Therefore, there are people who knows you, and want to be like you. You never know if they can come up to you, out of nowhere and ask for opinions and advice. You can't just say anything, you can say something you do, and something you follow. Keep in mind that there's a lot of things people see in you. How you behave can change the way they see you too. Believe it or not, people actually see what you do. If you have siblings, they see your actions without you knowing, and they could do the same things. Giving advice to people is easy, but they would want to see you follow your own advice too.

There's people who you might not know, but they do know you and they act the way you do because of the way they've seen you behave around them or around other people.

Electives can be helpful to students because it teaches them something new about the history of the different kinds of arts class and help them understand whats going on around the world and teach them how to play instruments and see where the origin is from and how it is played,art is teaches student s how to paint and make clay and shows who are most the famous painters,where they,d come from and how,d they became such great artists. drama shows who are the greatest actors,famous plays and how they became famous.

Students say that an elective is better than it be a required class because its like having free time but you get to do something that you dont get a chance to do and it could be a career in the future for someone who is interested in doing it and sometimes the counselor puts the students into an elective that dont like and its not a required class and if they dont like it they don,t have a choice but to stay in the elective .

Therefore students should be able to choose their own elective rather than it to be a required class that you need to pass in order advance into the next step of life and it will help them learn something in the future and remember what happened during their time in that they spent in that elective.

Try new thins is amazing. Because you take adventures on your self. And you live the risk on your own . While you earn more worth to try new things again.

Try new things also good .

The new experiences and old experiences are good. Because people can give examples of the old things that they had to live.

take new experiences make you more strong. Also new experience make change on you .

The first reason is that some people are avaricious, is a bad influence for the people that want grown in the jobs, school and in the milieu family, for example my brother not finish the school, Because He like the money and He think the best solution will be leak of the school for work more and have more money.

The first reason that inactivity should serve as a purpose is because people that aren't doing anything should be able to accomplish their work and other work so that they did not finish and they dont have an excuse to not do work. On the other hand people doing work have an excuse because if they are given a lot for work they might not have time to finish the other work but the people that finish working and have some time left should be given more work in till they done have anymore time at school or at work.

The second reason is that they don't accomplish work when they are doing something because they won't have time to finish the other work or they rush ans make a lot of mistake on their work and will get a bad report are grade on it so thats why some people don't accomplish their work when they are doing other things.

Learning or sharing wisdom and experience with her have taught me a lot of thing that is around the environment. The benefit of learning experience from people is because it help to make the right choice, help to know activities more easily, and also it help people to be strong.

Making the right choice is not something that everyone are able to do on their own. The experience and wisdom learned form people can help to know the mistake that have been done which will help them to prevent it form happening. It helps with learning from other failed experience in life which also help to bring the best out in making that right choice in life today.

People doing thing and knowing activities more quickly other it because they have more wisdom and experience for a long time or they have notice the activities form someone they know in their life time. Having the experience of knowing thing easily can happen in both in school or at the work place. It helps them to move forward with others that are high than moving backward.

It also help people to be strong in so many ways by giving them some encouragement that they can be better than what they were before. It also gives hope to a lot of people in today's life. Experience and wisdom can easily help people that are not too great in doing thing outside their home and also make them to the top of their school or their work.

Because Students will no have enough sleep with one and a half hours extra of school with homework,

also students will have less free time, and also student wouldn't have enough time to go spend with there family.

If the school board extended the school day by one hour and a half then students wouldn't have enough time to sleep because they have to do there homework , and that take probably one to two hours to finish there homework and then they will have to eat and get ready for bed.

Its fun to do many activities outdoors and its also good for you to be outside moving around and doing things.

Spending time outdoors are great for doing activities,and to see what other things you can do at parks. For one, playing catch is a good activity to enjoy with others, and to move around. People can find that playing catch is a good activity to enjoy outdoors, because most people play it differently and many of them can learn how to play, its also a good way to play fair with others, and to throw/catch a ball.

Secondly, riding bikes is a great activity to do at a park with your family or friends. Therefore, riding bikes is an amazing activity for outdoors, you can enjoy riding along the streets, and to enjoy the outside nature by looking around the park and to hear the people playing around having fun outside.

On the other hand, doing any other activities are good to enjoy outside. For example, playing football is a good game to spend time outside practicing or playing with friends, and tag is another game that kids love enjoying outside running around and laughing and playing fair with other childrens on the grass or even just chasing little things that they see, like a dog they like to go after a dog and pet it.

Conclusion.

FE3CA06DDCA1,"Why is it when someone asks you for advice there the one's talking most of the time? Here are 2 of the reasons I think that the person who asks for advice talks more than the one who is giving the advice. Reason 1 is they might want to give the on who is giving the advice all the info so then they can help them. Reason 2 is that they are give you as much detail as they have to give you good advice.

They will want to give you all the information so you can probably find a solution or fix to there problem. As in this sit ions where my friend needed some advice for a test she had coming up. She was not sure what to do to study for it. She was telling me what she had to study but then she said  I dont think these would help me much I told her to make flash cards out of the note she had then she did that. She was super stress. I think when your stressed you just say things that are on your mind as in you talk more.

If a person wants good advice they will want to give you all the details. If you know all the details you will most likely know how t fix it. Everyone needs so good advice because the how are they going to fix there problem. If you friend has a problem and they dont tel you all the details your not really gonna give then good advice.

In conclusion why you need advice you will talk more then the person who is given you the advice. When you are in a problematic event you will take a lot more because yo will be most likely stressed. Also if you give all the the details of your problem you will get good advice.

49F54A35F6F3,"Some people say that students are better off attending classes online, mostly because they can feel a sense of comfort and no worries of school tardiness. I say that it's better to not attend distant classes and attend them from the school itself.

Students are better off attending classes from the actual school because students tend to have more concentration while actually attending the class. When attending the class from home, students will be more concentrated on their home atmosphere, or what happens at home. Concentrating onto something usually comes from the atmosphere you are in. Attend your classes are better and more effective when the person is alerted or more attentive to their classes or courses.

Moreover, students will develop social communication when interacting with other students. Social communication is important because not only will you get to know the other person's side of knowledge, but you can get experience from the other person that could benefit or impact your way of making desicions in your life. Students will be more of an introvert if attend classes from home or distant classes. In this way, students will definitely develop working skills when they start having a job as an older person.

However, even if they won't be able to go through or worry about tardiness if taking distant classes, going to school knowing that there is tardiness, will prepare them for the future when running to work and making it on time. Making to school or work on time depends on how the individual is smart enough to manage their own time wisely.

In conclusion, the more preferable method for students is coming to school or the class session wherever it's taking place. In this way, students develop better communication, better concentration and develop time management. Students will become better individuals.

I See no problem not a big essue about using cell phones at school,a lot of students need the cell phones to stay informed or to keep in contact with the parents,students can use cell phone in case of an emergency at school. Cell phones are a safe thing for the students at this times. Some students don't have a way to search a subject or a problem because they don't have a computer with,so the cell phone is faster, and small easy to look through,share ideas with other students,point of view about a subject,political opinions,stay informed what is going on outside of school,students have to be informe about everything that happens outside of school,bloquing students devices can cause a bad effect and this will make then find other way to brake the rules again,and get what they want .I think students should be allowed to use cell phones for this reasons.

However, some students can take to other side,and don't pay atenttion in class because of the cell phones,a big part use cell phones to play games,or get distracted with music,and this can affect a lot of other students in the class,use to much of the cell phones also affect the social midia. Using social midia at school can cause a bad point of view of the school,examples of it can be recording fights, or sexual things. Most teachers don't allow studenst using cell phone during class because students can be out of the subject that the teacher is trying to teach,this can be a rock inside the boot.

I think the city council should adopted the curfew for teenagers because it'll keep them out of trouble. They're some teenagers who will stay outside to trouble the people. It's a good idea for some teenagers to go home at 10 P.M because they are on the street leasoner to muise, and doing nothing but to trouble athers. Will there some teenagers who is stuly for schools, and trying to sleep becuase they are going to schools. If the curfew is adopted, they should make a law that saying teenagers who is out on streets after 10 P.M would be breaking the law.

Most of the teen are jail because they are doing things they should not do. Some of them have gam but most of them not ever 18 to have a gam with them. Some of them is on jail for no reasons but they well find with teen who had gam, and other sutf with them. Most of the teen who have a gam not eve there's, some of the gam that teen have are find in water that people put in and all the thing that other person did in that gam are now everthings is the people that find th gam.

2B62F285FD21,"Its a good idea to have year-round school because you will not be out of school long that will make you forget what was just learned and will always have help from teachers all the time.

Being out of school for a long time can make students forget what was just learned and it's true because many kids have reported that they forgot what they have learned in that year of school. Shorter breaks is the way to go because you will be able to retain the information that the teacher taught last week. This is another advantage that you will have because students will be fresh and will have more time to learn and study for upcoming test and would probably even make them a better student.

Having a long break is desireable by all of the students but it can also be a negative thing, Thats why having year-round school can improve many things for an example it can improve your grades, better focus and understanding, and better opportunities in life. It will even make the school at one of the best schools to go because the percentage of passing scores, quality of learning, and the best teachers.

This will not just improve and make students better at school but can also give them opportunities and chances in life. Education is the most valuable thing in the world without it this world would of not had influential leaders and inventors. This can open new doors in life and it can make anyones dream career come true not mattering their race or class. Having year- round school is the answers to many solutions.

First acts of kindness has an impact on others because others may not be used to being kind to everyone around our environment.

Next showing kindness to other people is not something everybody does on a daily bases however that does not mean we hate each other we just don't show what kindness really looks like.

Finally it's not always good to be kind to others because other people like to be treated good or bad.

Kind isn't always the best choice.

First being kind isn't always the best choice in different situations. For example picking if a student should get bullied or choosing a friend for you to help on the test like who would a help.

Next kindness can also lead you to big trouble. For example u standing up for a student who gets hurt and bullied by the bully if your school has no cameras around it's easy for the bully to lie about the situation that happened with the kid who got bullied if there are no cameras in your local school.

Finally about the bullying part the person who is getting bullied by the bully and the person who is standing up for the kid who gets bullied they can even get in trouble for interfering.

Don't be kind to those who aren't good people

First students and others who are being mean to you they are probably not a good person therefore don't talk to them and shouldn't be kind to them.

Also a reason to not be kind to those who aren't good people is because they have the discipline to teach themselves to treat others right.

The people who said that technology has a negative effect on people's lives have their reasons. One of the most important reason and approved from experts is that technology is making people to not socialize. According to scientist now in days people rather to play on their electronic devices instead of going out. According to an article people expend at least 10 hours playing videos and using social media.

However, technology helps the people to communicate with others that live far away. A lot of people have now the opportunity to communicate with their family thanks to technology. Technology allows people to video call others and to have connection with others and socialize with people around the world via internet. A good example can be soldiers. Sometimes soldiers are out of the country and the only way they can communicate with their families is by video calls.

Also, technology makes people's lives easier because you can shop via internet, complete your work, and plan projects. Technology gives people an advantage to have an life without stress.

16B45E8AA9F3,"Honestly i think being honest can't always be hard or sometimes easy because, when you did something wrong you feel guilty, telling the truth gets rid of the guilt that you had, and also you feel a lot of stress. Letting the stress out in your body is good at one point so be honest!

Your body will feel like your hiding something and be afraid to talk so just be honest,

for an example, you broke your moms favorite vase but she doesn't know yet. ""You"" may be afraid to even talk to mother because ""you"" wont know if ""you should lie or be honest or you might even feel like you will get in trouble.

It's good to be honest because your parents will feel like they can trust you for an example being home by yourself and taking care of your younger siblings . If your not honest your parents might think that you're lazy and dont actually take care of your siblings while there out grocery shopping.

Not being honest can cause problems with you and your parents relationship. It's your job to be grateful of your parents, what they give you and how much they support you. If you have a friend who is good with their parents maybe try being like them and try your best to love and appreciate your parents at this moment.

Now that you know how to appreciate your parents and be honest and not lie, let me tell you this we all know we will lie maybe once or twice but after you can just say, ""Hey I'm sorry i was not telling the truth, will you forgive me?""

A cell phone can be a distraction for anybody specifically for a student. If students are allow to use their phone in their classroom for educational purposes they could get distracted with the other apps on their phone. For example: Sanpchat, Instagram, Facebook, or even a text message. All of this apps could distract the student from doing what he or she is supposed to be doing in the class.

All students most do their own work at all time to show the teacher what he or has learned in class. Having access to a cell phone in class could tempt the student to cheat on their class work or test. Also students could send each other answer through a text. Classroom should be a red zone at all time so students won't have the chance to cheat in their work.

Every student should be focus on one specific thing thing while they are in school which is to have good grades in their class. By being able to have access to their cell phone in class the student won't try as hard to keep their grade up. Not having their phone would push them to do better in the class. The student will have all their attention on getting their assignment done in time.

05ACEDBB9CB4,"A lot of students become involved in extracurricular activities, and that makes them don't have time enough to finish their homework and assignments. Schools should control student's involvement in extracurricular activities, because sometimes students can't make their own decisions in the right way and that will makes them don't focus a lot on their studying and education.

My first reason that the schools should control students' involvement in extracurricular is the student can involve in a lot of activities after school or during the school time that can make him be late to do his homework and he will be tired to study; and that makes him have a bad grades and he wouldn't have a good future.

Secondly, when the schools control the student's involvement that make the student more successful in his classes and that give him the chance to finish all of his assignments on the time; also that makes him more understandable to what is happening in all of his classes.

The third reason that the school should control the students involvement is the student will know how to spend his time in a right way and saving his time to the important things that would help him in his future, and makes him more responsible about his education and future.

Lastly, if the schools control the students involvement in extracurricular activities, they would know how and when the student become involved and they would know if the students would have time to the activities or not.

That was the reasons about how the schools should control the students involvement in activities and how it is good for the student's education and future on the same time. Because students can't make their own decisions; sometimes they feel that somethings good for them but it is not, so they need someone more mature to show them the right ways and right things.

Another negative effect that technology has given us is No Contact, The new genration does not have contact as like people would have had before. We need contact becuase it shows that we can work with people and it also shows that we are social.

One positive thing about technology is new research for example now a days we can just go on google and search up things we might need help with, For example if you are confused over a topic or you want to know a little bit more about it you can just go on google and search it up. Another positive effect technology has given us is Locations, Locations is a part of everyday's life for example if you need to go somewhere you can just go on your phone and search up the name of the place where you want to go. Technology is something we need now a days because there's creations all over the world being created everyday.

I think it's head for some of the student to work and graduate in three years instead of four years. The most immopat think is that if the students faill a class they can't graduate the hight schools befor they pass the class they faill.

Most of the student's don't want to take a courses during the summer because they want to have free time , they don't want to work on summers. Some students work and save some money for college. They don't want to work for schools on summers. They're some family who love traveling with they're kids.

Most of the students want to take a elective courses but not in summer. Couses whay want to take is art, muise, and language they want. Some of the classes that students take as a elective courese can help them in college or in work force.

I think that working in group or working alone has some advantages and disadvantages. But in my opinion I would say that one that is more beneficial is working in a group. Working in a group is less work and more ideas.

As I was saying that their are advantages and disadvantages, My first advantage of working alone is that you get to work alone with no distraction from others. Second advantage is that you can focus and ask the teacher for help. Last reason is that you can put as many ideas you want and a lot of effort and ask the teacher to check your work to see how you doing working. The disadvantage of working alone is that you will not get the work done faster. My second reason is that working alone is not fun because you working independent and doing all the work.

My first advantage is that working in group you get to hear different ideas from each other. My second advantage is that you can talk together and gets lots of ideas and fix mistakes together. Last advantage is that working in a group you can finish the work faster. The first disadvantage is that working in a group their is going to be too much talking and also not focusing. Second disadvantage is that when you are working together some times one person does the whole work and the other doesn't. Last disadvantage is that you can easily get destructive and not get the work done.

To conclude this I think working in a group is more beneficial. I choose working in group because their are many advantages. Therefore working in a group is less work and turning in work fast, As a result you won't have to worry about asking for help or not having ideas because thats is why you are in a group to get your work done and have a lot information.

I think is not benefit for student, that take classes online because in the video maybeabilities ,and dont have a teacher is not organized dont have partner when are you take the classes online.

Teacher: when are you take the video online you dont have a teacher for tell you what do you need do in the class ,and him cant help in your work for example the teacher cant help with kahoot or quizlet or with others strategies of work .

Organized: when you take the class online you dont have organized, if you need highlights or pensil for write something for read it or explain your work.

Partners: in the class you dont have partners or others people with you, just are with your teacher online, but is not your confidence or your friend like in the school the many people is your frends However; the people can say you cant take the class online because you work for ten hours for this you need to take the class online, but is not bad idea take the class, but you cant work or cant study after school with partner.

Conclusion: you dont are prepared for take the class online worst is a video coferencing because you dont have teacher, organized ,and partners in the end you cant take the class because is more difficult for learn in your work. is more better take the class in the school you have more benefit how you can pass the class and more oportunities that the school have for you ,and in the school you can help new students ,and in the school you can protrude like better student in the school.

Some people think that if you fail you should just give up right then and there. some people say that if they give up when they fail they should get up and try again and never loss hope, to determined, and to dedicate on what they are trying to achieve.

Everyone person fails in some point of their lives its part of life to fail no one is perfect. people should never loss hope if they fail they should be determined to make it through and be successful. Hope is so important in peoples lives because lets say if someone loses they child and if that person losses hope they would stop looking for their child and if they stop looking for their child they will never find him or her. Failure is important in peoples lives because it make people to not lose hope but also it makes them to dedicate on what they are trying to succeed.

People should dedicate on what they are trying to achieve or on what they want to succeed. dedication is very important in everyone lives. Cristiano Ronaldo is so dedicated to soccer that is why he is so successful he was playing in the best league in Spain now he is paying in the best league in Italy. many people admire Cristiano Ronaldo because started from the bottom and now he is one on the best player and is one the player that gets payed the most.

Should people make their own decisions, or shoud they seek guidance from experts and authorties.

If you take decisions, you can have a good life for you'r future. For Exmaple if you want go to the College but you talk with your self and said no go to the college because you not are Intelligent, so you try to deisions go to the college or not go.

you can take your own decisions,For Example: if you take one decisions are bad or no the people need to repect you'r decisions because is you'r decisions,So They not want to know why you take that decisions in my opinion the people only want the bad for you.

You can take more control about you'r decisions,For Example: you can have more control about you'r decisionsFor Example:you can have more control about you'r decisions if you control you'r decisions you can take good decisions and that is good for take decisions

So, you need to have contro about decisions.

you can have you'r own decisions is good to take you'r decisions because you have more capacity to take other decisions, So in my opinion is good to have a decisions because can help to you in the Future but if you take something good for you'r life or for decisions.

Playing a sport is the best way to make our bodies stronger and healthy, it also helps us mentally when you are going through times going outside and playing helps you a lot. Playing a sport in school helps you have more energy and be ready to learn it likes opens your mind. Soccer for example is helps your body be stronger, Volleyball helps your hands be more stronger, Basketball helps you jump higher, and Football helps you run faster.

Writing or coloring the yearbook is a great idea too, because you are writing something that everyone is going to see so i know you gonna write neat and correctly. Coloring is good for our brains too it helps us be calm and out of stress. Spelling is one of the most important things and writing helps it improved it, coloring is something that not everyone knows how to do it, but by practicing we are gonna learn.

Serving in a student council helps you a lot because you learn something very important and thats learning how to communicate with other people and be nice. Sometimes its hard to communicate or talk to other people but we have to do it because sometimes the people needs someone to talk to and someone to be there for them.

I'm not against it because some people are failing their classes especially me and i would want to go to an after school homework club because one it would be helpful, two sometimes I forget that I have homework, and three sometimes I just want to get it over with and be done with the homework.

One of my reasons that I'm not against the after school club is because the students can get there grades up and have more practice when you take any test that you don't know about. For my opinion I would like to have this club because some teachers go really fast when there teaching and I can't catch up to them and it's really difficult for me. Some of the students don't know what the teacher is teaching about because maybe the subject there learning is there weakest strength to learn about.

My second reason is that students need this class because they want to achieve in life. Maybe someone wants to go to college to learn about photography but the school they want to go to is too expensive to afford like for example they want to go to a well good college but it's to expensive but the person who wants to be a photographer needs to apply for a scholarship that means they need to have good grades, participate in after school activity and much more this is why students like me need to have a after school homework club.

Today in the actuality is easier to take classes or courses, online or video conference, because the system of education is always trying to improve them self as everything in the world. The internet is our big source that we need everywhere and in different circumstances and the technology is a big advance that has a lot of benefits for us, like make our life easier.

My point of view about the student attending classes from home. First, most of the students in High School are teenagers, if they are in their homes taking classes it make the possibility that they do not socialite with the people and they can not find a firm personality. Second, the students could have problems in their vision in cause of the long time looking a monitor, laptop, tablet, Etc. Third, some of the students are beneficiary of their free lunches in school, so, if they are in home it will be more expensive for the parent to pay extra food. To conclude, those were some of my points of views or disagrees about attend to school from home.

This is a list about the agrees and it could be a benefit in my opinion:

Do not have to spend gas going to school.

Do not spend in different clothes everyday.

The government, do not have to pay a lot of teachers, so maybe taxes can get lower.

We can use a different schedule to see classes, and the other time to work.

The students do not have to socialize with the teacher, so, no disagrees and problems between the student and the teacher.

This ideas was basically what i think about attend classes from home, maybe it could be better or maybe no, the mostly reason i think is fine to attend school from home is, if you have a disability or sickness that don't let you go to school.

In my second year I decide to talk with more people and be positive person and because of that I star to have new friends and more teachers like me and when a teacher likes you they help you more and thats a small way to show that have a positive actitude is the key in life, and because i'm not a smart student, that extra help that the teachers give me, it help me to pass my classes.

In my third year, well it was pretty fun because when I change into a positive attitude i got new frinds and when i was in problems they help me, like i losse my pencil they borrow me one, or when i miss my bus they give me a ride to my home or they give me a number of a bus that is close to my house, when i was apsent they ask for my missing work so they can give it to me.

Those who believe schools should offer classes online have their reasons because research shows that 80% of the students that go to high school work after school. They get home late and they have to do homework, and they go to bed too late and having to wake up at least at 7 am to go school it's hard. They are falling asleep in class and they don't want to do any work. Taking classes online helps because they can take them at anytime.

Also, some students have to walk to get to school. In winter they have to suffer all the cold weather and that's what make them sick. Last year I saw a student who broke his arm cause it was snowing and the sidewalk was really slippery,and I also saw a guy who got beat up by a group of guys on the street he was on his way home,and if they can take classes online they would not have to walk to school, and those situations wouldn't happen.

In addition, research shows that 70% of the students that have attended classes online have been successful which means taking classes online really helps students. They can rest more at home and they don't have to wake up early every morning.

In conclusion,schools should provide classes online because colleges,universities also provide them and most of the people who have taken them have been successful from their classes. That is the best thing schools could do for the students.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5204391,3.4852316,3.58283,3.5882866,3.631261,3.5407362,3.3821962,3.2020202,3.568616,3.4811883,3.1244373,3.0866706,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,333,12,0.4474474474474474,27.75,3,6,"{'80', '7', 'online', '70', 'homework', 'anytime'}"
D2E545CFEBF3,"I would agree and disagree at the same time because their can be good reason and bad reason of why it good to extend 2 hours of school and working for 10 hours each day. My first reason is that it good extending the 2 hours helps you learn more things and catch up with any work. What is good about Working for 10 hours each day is that you will have money for colloge and save up. What is bad for working 10 hours is that you will be tired and sleepy.

For example if you work four-day week you should work at least for 8 hours only because you need to get enought sleep, leave some time for home work. But it also can be good because you can only work for four-days and rest the week days. Working more than 8 hours you will feel tired,sleepy and frustrated. Therefore it better to work only 8 hours instead of 10 hours because it too much,as a result you can get bad consequence or bad grades.

My other reason is that I think school should not follow this model because working each day 10 hours it too much. However their can be bad consequence of working 10 hours and extendidng

2 hours in school. My first reason is that you can be tired and not listining to the teacher while she teaching. Second reason is that if you extend the hours of school many student will be livid for staying more hours in school.

I think that the school should not extend the hours is because some teachers need to be in places too,needs to rest and also needs more time on grading papers. I also think that many students have part time jobs and also they need to be somewhere. Some students will be tired and sleepy. Another reason I have is that student needs to go home early to go do their homework,rest alittle.

We have to be society to not procrastinate about daily tasks. If we are always participating and if we are always involving ourselves in an event or task that is beneficial to oneself or other. It helps build a sense of standards for society and also builds up a persons attitude

Accomplishing something does not always mean achieving a goal, it could also be perform regular tasks with the best benefits.

They have to fight for benefits what they want and no waist any opportunity. In my case i am always an inactive person and lose a lot of opportunity along the way. The opportunities I had and i lost because i am an inactive person and that's bad.

It is better to fight every day to achieve the things we want in life. With the thing that i had to past is better to fight and strive to be successful.

Active person can help people reach their goals, It feel good help people and use time wisely. In this world people have big goals in order to reach these goals people need to work for them. Small action like help or participating in community people take that like a big change in society. Time is limited in a day people use this time to accomplishing they goals.

I personally think that in life there is always up and downs. For example, when i got bad grades i always think on what am i not doing right so i can fixed it. However, to success in life you have to failure more than once but you have to know that there is going to be obstacles that are going to bring you down but you don't have to let them stop you because you have to think on what you want to accomplish or in what you want to success. If a person losses interest in something they want to, then they're not going to keeps going. In conclusion, you have to fall so you can get up and keep going to the goal.

Loss of enthusiasm can not give you success in life. For example, when you have a goal and there is many obstacles is because your close to get to rich it. However, you can keep doing what you love so you can accomplish the goal that you wanted. Although, there will always be somethimg that try to stop you but you don't have to let stop you. In conclusion, if you don't loss enthusiasm you can do whatever you want.

To success in life you have to think positive and act positive in front of anything that want to stop you.

BDF13939FA26,"Students may say inactivity is the way to go, However other student say keeping yourself occupied will lead you towards achievement. But staying occupied is the way to go if you wanna be successful and achieve things in life. Sitting around and doing nothing wont lead you to anything sucessful in life.

If your at home sitting around having nothing to do will not help you to be successful. If you try to find something productive to do it will help you in the future. To be productive or to do something productive really does'nt have to be school work related it can be anything like having a job, chores or helping around the community.

Lets say you have home work but you dont feel like doing it, because your used to not doing anything and or are lazy to do it. which means you are more likely to procasanate. On the other hand if your used to doing your work the same day its assigned and or turn it in on time you are less likely to procasanate because you are used to staying occupied and doing all your work.

From my own expierence, when i was 14-15 years old i wouldnt do anything at home or at school which caused me to do negative things that didnt lead me to achieve my goals at that moment. Now that im 17 years old i keep myself busy by doing school work or working my part time job, which wont cause a negative effect on me because im preparing myself for my future and life goals.

Dear Generic_Name

I write to teacher Generic_Name today with the benefit of work in group. The work in group is more better then work alone, in the beneficial is the student work in group is have more opportunity of learn more with other students in the class, they can work more better and understand more quickly the theme in the class and have more collaboration, learn to respect other students. They in the group can say new ideas for the team.

I think in the personal the work in group is more productivity in the student because have a good communication with the students and teacher, they have more positive attitude in the ideas and participation.

For example, students in the group work more and learn more quickly because in group have a higher quality of ideas, and students can change ideas together about the theme in the class and have a better determination in the job of the class.

Second, work in group have a big benefit in the class because students understand problems more quickly, and they have solution in theme complicated with ideas and dedication in class.

Third, students have collaboration with other students have a good relation and learn to respect others person for religion or ideas. They have more communication in the class and have more better grade in the school.

However, work alone not have good result because almost all the student have fear to say ideas for the critic of other students in the class, and they have slow work in the class for complication of the theme.

The preference is work with a group have more benefit in the student and teacher to learn and teach other students in the school have more communication, better work and good relation in the school.

sincerely

FE14D7378CFB,"Do you agree or disagree about imagination being more important than knowledge ? I believe its important to get peoples opinions on this question because i think Albert Einstein would be curious about what people think.

Once they have chose what they chose they could talk about it, give each other some details, also communicate with another, ask questions on to why they chose what they chose.

I disagree wit Albert Einstein because imagination is something you imagine in your head or dreams it can be real only sometimes. I agree with knowledge because it happens in real life and when you do something you have the knowledge to know it right away. Students use their knowledge in school to learn about English.

In school i use my knowledge by reading books and by reading i can understand what the book is talking about and i will know how i will write a short summary of the book. My second detail is i can use my knowledge in soccer because i can learn new skills and read a book all about soccer and i can understand that i can use my knowledge by knowing what reading is. Imagination wouldnt be more important than knowledge because the things that you will imagine probably wont come to real life. Imagination isnt a smart way to use the word important because it wont really help students, maybe even adults. Knowledge i know that its a smart way to say important because it does help students in school, sports, maybe even with some decisions they will make in life.

Albert Einstein probably asked us to agree or disagree with him because he wants to know what are thoughts are and would want students, adults, teachers to communicate with each other and talk about why they agreed or disagreed with him.

In my conclusion i think students can succed in life using knowledge because its a smart decision to make in life by just thinking if its a good or bad idea your knowledge could help make that good decision for you",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.1527858,3.095186,3.2560415,3.2249818,3.1978164,3.1613133,2.6603124,2.904941,3.240855,2.9108698,2.7292345,2.3193803,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,346,13,0.4248554913294797,26.615384615384617,5,3,"{'wont', 'disagreed', 'soccer'}"

To begin with, when you play soccer there are two teams. Each team has to work together to win. I think soccer is a fun activity to play, because you can learn how to work in teams . In my opinion it helps you improve your friendly skills. Soccer helps you on how to work in teams. I've seen some famous soccer players on TV play. At first when they join a team they don't get along with the rest. But when time goes by they start working as a team. It helps them talk to others and work as one team.

Also, when you play soccer you have to think what you're going to do next. So soccer helps you improve your thinking skills. Most people are not good at thinking fast. It would be helpful for them to play soccer. It can help you think of new ideas. maybe in an emergency it might help you think faster on what to do. it can also help you develop new ideas. It makes you pick the best choices you have and what to do with them. Playing a sport it's going to help you in the future, even if you think it's not.

Finally, soccer is a fun sport to play, because it helps you run around and exercise. It can help you stay healthy and stay in shape. Nowadays people don't like to play sports. They just be in their house watching TV shows,playing video games, or just doing nothing. People focus too much on the internet that they forget how to play sports and do fun stuff. I think that people should go outside and try something new while you can. Some people regret not playing any sports when they were younger.

22FDAB421C71,"Albert Einstein once said, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge.""

I believe that it is Imagination is more important than knowledge, because with Imagination you can Form pictures in your mind, you can create interesting ideas and fantasize about something that is exciting.

Firstly, you can form pictures in your mind. Creating pictures in your mind is useful, because you can draw pictures that is in your mind, like sketching a house that you want. You can form pictures in your mind by visualizing a situation that is interesting, like playing a game in virtual world. You can create interesting ideas that you can use to draw picture, like using a digital art to create a picture by thinking an interesting ideas. Forming pictures is really important.

Secondly, you can create interesting ideas. You can create something that will give a lot of attention like creating a fantasy book about Wizards vs witches. You can be creative by creating interesting ideas, like having a unique plans about something that is cool. You can create quotes, like

Albert Einstein did, because he had a interesting Idea about Imagination.

Creating interesting ideas is unique.

Lastly, you can fantasize about something that is exciting. Fantasizing can be exciting sometimes, because you can imagine an situation that is not real, like having a awesome superpower. You can be good at something that your not good at by fantasizing it that you can do it, like playing basketball and I also do this a lot because Im not good at studying.

You can create awesome ideas, like building a wooden car with painting on it. Fantasizing something is important as well.

I conclude that forming picture in your mind, creating interesting ideas and fantasizing about something that is exciting is more important knowledge.

In conclusion, these three reasons is why Imagination is more important than knowledge.

It is a honor for me to respond your statement about human individuality and I agree with your statement and i believe that be yourself in a world is hard. The world is something that the human we can not answer and be yourself is definitely the same is hard everything is hard but you can get a lot achievements for do and treat the best the you can.

First, I think the when you are alone and the city or other place and you got this situation you are alone there is not family, friends, parents nobody is there but you have to be sure that you can live without people that grow and start think what is going to happen. I believe that everyone can do everything that we want each achieve or something else because everyone can be smart, we are the people that we wanna be and yes if you are alone in the a big world you are going to scared first you have to work and pay everything that you want but that is help you to get the greatest accomplshment.

Second, be yourself is everything that all people want because to can express the real person that you are not a fake person cause if you are in a meeting or school or whatever place you have to be yourself and demonstrate the person who are you inside the feeling the you have all the characteristics that you have the point is to desmonstrate the world the you can be yourself and make more to get something else and be something else.

Next, desmonstrate the person who are you one reason is you can get more friends because your are showing to other person who real you are.

In clonclusion, be yourself in a world is more better then not we have to continue trying the person who wanna be for get more achievements and other things. Thanks for give me this opportunity to response you what i think and give you my opinion.

Most people realize how they can get there work done when they are actually doing something. You can do anything if you really think like Thomas Jefferson, Just like most of the people say '' Work hard to be succeful

'' if you never do nothing you will never finish what you have to do. Just think about how much people wanna be the same thing we wanna be , if you really wanna be succesful you have to work and you will always get stuff done.

Most people dont be active all the time and they take advantage of technology because now days technology can do everything. Nobody have any excuse for no finishing work. we live in a world where if u be smart doing what u suppose to do you will get it ''DONE''. One good example is:The president just think how much work he have to get done to make a country look good,no problems,etc.

It really is wonderful how much work can we finish if we always doing theres no excuse for not doing work Just like i said i think that everybody who work a lot they gonna accomplish more every time they doing something and think how fast they did it just because you are not thinking about how much work you have to get done and never think inactivity also serve a purpose because if u dont do nothing you will not be the person you always think about or goals you have in mind, Every goal or career you wanna do takes time and time goes fast so you have to take advantage of everything and make sure you always doing what you suppose to do and not wasting your time saying i will do it next time because theres no next time.

First, Now a day many students are failing classes because most of the teacher allow to students use cell phone during they are teaching.

If students may allow to use cell phone then they can distortion by study, and their force can be in phone. When we keep use phone then we can't listen what teacher saying. For explain, last year in my histroy class we can allow to use phone so, when go to histroy class I alway usemy phone and i never listen to teacher.

I fail the class and sol because of use cell phone everyday.

School may not be allow to use cell phone in classroom because if school allow to use cell phone in classroom then students may not be able to learn anything.

If students are allow to use cell in school, then when students are doing testing they might be chage to chat on test.

Students can leave study, they gonna force on play phone.

Finally, When students have work in classroom they are so lazy to do it because they are busy to play game or use phone. In school we have lot of work to do, if teacher give us using phone then students might not do it. So, we have work then teacher sholud not give us using phone because lots of students are busy with phone or play game.

While, Many students are distorton by cell phone because they can't force on study.

Dear principle,

I would like to help in the community service group. I think it is very important for us as student's to help in the community service. It is important because we need to show that we care for our community and world. Some people say that it is a waist of time to be helping the community and the world they think that that's why their are people to work and take the trash out and stuff like that. But we cant leave other people that work all day and all week when they are tiered and want to rest to be picking our left overs!! Some people are eating at the park, mall, store, etc. and they think that when they are eating they could just through their rappers and some food on the ground and not pick it up they live it their so others can pick it up for them and i think that is WRONG!!! The people that have food, drinks, etc. and are eating any were they should throw their trash in the trash can's when they are done eating their food. And i think if we pass by trash being in the floor we should pick it up because to be honest i don't think another person would pick it up but they should. We don't want our community/world to be dirty and stinky with trash all over the place. We want our world to be clean and with nice fresh air that we could breathe with NO problem. That's why i want to join in the community service group to help our community /world be a better place for other people and us even if others don't want to help but i think that every one should be in the community service group and help the community. Well this is what i think dear principle and i hope you like my letter!!!

9DE684107A66,"should churchill's statement About the importnat role that failure plays in the pursuit of success be true. I think that failure plays a big role to success but is just for those who really want to changed their lifes. First of all, learned something from any failure. Second of all, A failure shows up the real people. Third and most important, try not to do the same failure over and over.

""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiams"". First of all,learned something from any failure because we are humans and we all make big mistakes in our lifes. Those who learned form their mistekas are the best to help the ones that are passing the same process. Learn because there would be always more failures in our lifes. Second of all, a failure shows up the real people because those who you think are good friends would help you on a failure. the person that you thought was the worst could be the only one helping you. An example, A real girlfriend would never run away in your first failure. Third and most important, try not to do the same failure over and over becuase the first think you loss is your enthusiams when you had been passing the same failure for many times, it becomes harded not to loss it. There is always gonna be more failures in our lives but, if u dont even pass one it would be more difficult to pass more then one at the same time.

My conclusion, everyone has a failure or more in their lifes but the most succes full thing of a failure is to pass the page knowing that you had learned something good of it and you wont do the same mistake ever again.

Many people have their ways of learning certain things. Some may like working in groups because it makes the work easier, bring up their confidence and social life. Others may like working alone because it helps people concentrate, they like to get their work done faster and they don't feel uncomfortable towards other people.

First, Working in groups might make the work easier, help bring up their confidence, or their social life. It can make their work easier by separating the work to make it faster to deal with the work. It can help bring their confidence by talking to other people. It can help them bring courage to make new friends and learn about each other. It can also help them with their social life. Instead of being on their phones they are learning together and getting work done. They are also getting to know each other.

Second, Working alone can help people concentrate in their work, they could be fast workers, and they don't feel uncomfortable towards new people. It can help them by concentrating in their own work to feel more comfortable with themselves. They could be fast workers because they are not being distracted and they can go on their own speed. They won't feel uncomfortable or awkward by other people because some people don't like meeting or being with people. Most of them just want to be alone or with people they might know.

All in all, find what you feel more comfortable with it could be being alone or being in a group to study with people you might want to get to know or with your friends that your comfortable with.

Getting a bad grade on a test or quiz. Their are kids in middle and high school who study and at times get bad grades. These kids have trouble knowing that they failed their test or quiz. One way to provent this from happen is by having a good mindset. They can deepdown be mad, but if they put tell themselfs that ""i'll try harder next time"" they could do better on the retake or on the next quiz or test. Even when some kids that study a lot and fail some of they overreact during it.

Overreacting is another promble kids have. Some kids overreact by saying ""if i fail this i wont get a job"". Other times kids thing negativly about themselfs and they bring themselfs down. They could be telling theemselfs "" i'm going to fail"" or anything else instand of that they sould try telling them say ""i'm going to try to do my best. They dont know intill they try to do their best.

Having a good mindset can help. Havin a good mindset meaning to think positivly and to know that not having passed their test or anyting in life. That everyone had to start from one place and build on. Other times kids should learn from their mistakes. They might have or might have not fail and they shouldn't put it on themselfs because they could fail if not.

Also the student need to came to school for learn and be a good person and them they can work after school.

Ruler the school dont want the student just came for two day. Because one of disadvantages is they are not going to make a great grade . Second because the students are not coming school, and they dont know what the teachers are began doing during class with the other student and they will have a bad grade for not coming and dont doing the work for the classes.

One of benefits they have began work is making money. Because they are working, four-day for a week so that make they have a good time to work and make ten hours a day but they are just going to work and not come to school.

The first issue about year-round schools is more stress, the main thing students stress about is what clothes should they wear to school everyday it makes students to buy more clothes even when they have a lot of clothes because some students want to look better than everyone else in school by not wearing the same clothes everyday to school. students are not the only people who stress teachers will stress about what lesson should they teach and they will a lot assignment to grade.

The second issue about year-round schools is less vacation time, students will have 3 to 4 week vacation over the summer so student won't have as much vacation time as they would like to have because 3 to 4 week vacation is not a lot of time for student to go to another country for long time. parents will be affected by this too because some responsible parents can't leave their kids and go to another country alone.

Most of it is caused by bullying. Years ago the government allowed students to attend online courses and a good amount of students left high school and stayed to take online courses.

Students should attend online courses because bullying would decrease nand it would be easier to find your way through the website instead of walking from class to class.

Bullying would have a major decrease because students would be at home instead of school. Everyday students get harassed by other students and then up to the point where it drives them to commit suicide. Students would be at their house where it's safe and less distracting. Also, some students are too shy to be around other people so they get bullied for it. Every parent doesn't want to see their kid get bullied. There so much negativity being spread around and it not only affects the victims life it also affects their families.

It would be easier to find your way through online courses instead of walking class to class. It could be difficult for some students to find their way around the school because of how big it might be. With only the press of a few buttons, students would easily find their way towards their next assignment.

0BEB8F7F5A64,"First impression are very important when you first meet someone. Many people say first impressions are almost impossible to change, but i strongly disagree with that. Majority of the time when we meet someone we already think of them in a certain way, but our judgment could always be wrong. Thats why i believe first impressions could always change.

I believe that first impressions can change the way people think of you. Sometimes people can be irritable or just in a really bad mood because something is occurring in their lives, but in reality that's not how they really are. One reason first impressions can be wrong, is because maybe they didn't get enough sleep at night, and they have to get up early to go to work, or school in the morning. For example, i am not much of a morning person, so when i wake up in the mornings i can be rude, and people might not want to talk to me, but if you see me later in the afternoon i will be smiling, and laughing. Another reason first impressions could be wrong, is because they might not feel comfortable with the people who they are surrounded by, and be very shy, but once you start talking to them they change. For example, my best friend and i used to hate each other. I used to think she was annoying, and rude, and i am guessing she thought the same for me. One day we both started to talk to each other, and i found out we have many things in common, and that we are like the same people. That same day we became the best of friends, now we are basically like sisters. This is why i think that first impressions can always change.

In conclusion, i believe that from now on as we move forwards in life we shouldn't assume what the other person is like, and not to always rely on first impressions because they could always be wrong.",4.0,4.0,3.5,4.5,4.0,4.0,3.705192,3.7619615,3.7779603,3.8012657,3.8852842,3.8053958,3.967657,4.0127215,3.7628977,3.6564667,4.29294,4.2616563,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,339,15,0.4572271386430678,22.6,3,1,{'forwards'}

Sometimes you need to be alone, so you can find your inner friend or skills that you didn't know you had.

Some benefits of working alone are that is your own opinion, no one else have to say a word, and even if you are wrong is your own fault that you have to learn and go through it. Lonely means a lot of things, and people take that word in a mean side; sometimes you just do not want to work in groups, because you know that you are capable to do great things on your own, without the needed of selfish, noisy, or stubborn opinions.

To begin with,by practicing playing my favorite sport ,soccer everyday after school and on my free time; because I was in my school team and I was really bad and weak at it .Practicing helped me to overcome my weakness and to learn from my mistakes ,and also to know the rules of the game and basis of soccer.

Some people believe inactivity serve a purpose that led you to success;however, we gain life experience and learning from our mistakes if we are always doing something or we accomplished more . Also,by practicing soccer everyday and working hard on it,I learned tricks and how to kick the ball directly to my teammates and how to be good goal keeper and catch the ball as well. And that gives me more experience and strength to continue.

Another example,one day we were playing and their was judgments there,choosing the best player to be in the ""International Soccer Team"" ,depending on how the player plays and how they follow the rules. Three days later, I got nominated to participate in the International team and I also got honored for being the best player in the game and of course, that led me to successful opportunity in the future.

To accomplish something is not easy, you have to face a lot of difficulties and facing those difficulties and get over it that's what meant by accomplish .It will walk you through a lot to accomplish something in your life, you just have to keep going and to work hard and never give up and all of that will pays off by being success in your life .",2.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.2577593,3.1079044,3.3595955,3.254473,3.1804857,3.2068763,3.5657587,3.7363372,3.9700565,3.9150202,3.9504187,4.31996,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,345,10,0.463768115942029,34.5,1,4,"{'teammates', 'keeper', 'inactivity', 'soccer'}"

I strongly agree getting help form a expert or authority is much better than following your own instincts. Reasons are teacher and therapist; Both help out a lot in peoples life. For example my friend Generic_Name and me.

Therapist help me when I was going through hard times. My family had split up, a good friend pass away, and I got bully in school, so many confusing and terrible events happening which teared me apart. Trying to work so hard fixing everything by myself, but non of my ideas work. Until I talk to a therapist about my problems. The therapist guide me to a better understanding of my life, and what to do next. Together we solve my problem with the bully in school, and help me got over my family split and my friend death.

Secondly, my friend Generic_Name is a senior in high school. She was never good in math, nor did she pass the math SOL. Generic_Name had chances to retake the math sol to graduate. The next one she taking will be the last SOL . Generic_Name study on her own and worked very hard. She like to be self-reliance But at this point it was not working, so Generic_Name ask her math teacher to help out before the SOL. The teacher saw Generic_Name had a lots of mistake, so the teacher guide her to fix it. Also teach her on the math problem she didn't know. Seeking guidance form the math teacher help Generic_Name pass the SOL.

In conclusion getting help form experts or authorities help, in ways being self reliance can't. Seeking guidance help a better understanding of the situation, less mistake, controlling stress, and learn something you did not know.

When you work in a group you can finish faster. For example, if there is a group of three people, one people can be doing a job, while you are doing an other, and the third people can be doing an other. That is a smart and easy way to finish the work faster.

Working in the group can be very helpful for planing how to do a project. Like as, all the people in the group gives their opinion of how to do the project and everyone in the group hears the ideas and them, they vote for the best idea in the group. That is a key point of working in the group everyone express them self and the work become easily.

In a group you can have better ideas. For example, you are in a group, and you have an idea and you tell the idea to the group, all the people in the group is going to give an opinion, and they will tell you if your idea is good or it is bad.

Having to take those classes just adds classes you need to graduate. It is also all a waist of time if the students are not actually in to it.

Firstly, these classes are just extra classes that we dont really need. In my opnion, I believe that student should be able to graduate highschool with the classes they need. English, Math, History and Science are all classes that can support them when they go to college. If student don't take these classes they may also graduate ealier then they are supposed to. For example, I go to a highschool where I get the credits I need and I am able to graduate a year earlier. Which I think everyone should have the chance too.

Lastly, if a student is not interested in one of these classes they won't try. Even if they do try and fail then its just holding them back. They will start stressing over it when they won't actually end up needing it. Student will also consume most of their time bringing up their grade in these classes that they will not work on other classes. Then they will end up failing.

On the other hand, some might say these classes should be required because student might find interest in one of those and would like to persue it after graduating. I think that if a student is interested then they should be allowed to take the class of your choice. However, if your not then you should not be pushed to take them when you dont want to.

Students can improve their grades in different ways they can do particularly activities like sports, if students do sports they can practice their beneficent for do activities after school. One important thing is that students can receive help from others students or teachers,a lot of students stay after school for receive help especially when they have missing assignments,if they do not understand a topic.

Secondly,students can spend time with their friends, this is important because some students spend their time in technological things like phones,video games and things like that ,others students like to stay after school because they can share time,ideas or comments how they are in their grades,by sharing ideas they can help each other in their work,especially if they do not understand something.

Now a days people jump into conclusions, they never met the person, they just go off upon looks. For example say a teenager is wearing all black with ripped jeans and they got their pants down low, adults are going to think that teen is possible a gangster or a thug but thats not the case, thats just the style now a days.

First impression can change overtime, once you get used to something your mindset changes, say you meet a friend and you guys start talking and your friends starts giving you an attitude, your going to assume that your friend doesn't like you so you keep that mindset. Yall start talking again and this time it's going way better, you and your friend are laughing, overall just having a good time now your opinion has changed towards the person.

By doing this 3 year program, you can start college early. In today's society, finishing school early may be a big benefit. If I had the chance to do this program, I would take that chance. You may be looked at different but in a good way. Also, by starting college early it can be a huge advantage to your future.

Finishing school early can bring you into the work force. I would believe by finishing school early, it can be a huge benefit for looking for new jobs. Also, putting on your resume that you graduated early, the employers would look into it and see that you had to take summer and evening classes. You would look your very intelligent and responsible.

If having a year off, and don't know what to do, you can explore. If I had that year off I would use the time to see new things, things that i've never seen before. By taking the year off, you would still be on track in your schooling. In life some people don't want to go into school because it is overwhelming. Have the time to go out, if not then you'll regret not having that time to yourself.

By taking a 3 year course of high school, you can start looking into jobs, have time to explore, and you can start college early. Some say that finishing high school early, you don't get the same high school experience as others that don't do the 3 year program. But finishing high school a year early, can bring you more benefits than just doing the normal 4 years.

Although many of the teenagers are constantly restricted nevertheless, the teenagers more younger`s that 18 has their own`s responsibilities and obligations to themselves and for their families because, the teenager`s need education, a home and money.

That is because it's not the same thing as going to school. Taking classes at home is not the same as taking classes in school because in school you have a teacher that can help you, if you don't understand what's going on in the class. Also another reason is that in school you have a teacher that can teach the student actual lessons that the student can benefit from. Third reason is because sometimes you will just be lazy and not do the work and just do whatever you want since you're at home. No one will stop you, or give you remainders to do your work. Overall, I don't think the students would benefit from taking classes at their homes.

I would think that online classes would be harder and difficult to understand. In fact, being in a normal class you learn more and you are all catched up with your work. Being in school will help you communicate more with others, you can make or meet some new friends,the teacher will help you with some work if you need it. Online classes are harder because the student might not know what to do and he/she will be lost. Some people might find that online classes are hard and some might not it just depends on the individual. Some people just learn differently.

In conclusion everyone is different. What might work for you, might not work for the next person. Some people might benefit from talking online and some might not it. Honestly it just depends on what the students perfers online classes or school classes.

Some example could be emotions, not giving up, and a quote ""Third time is the charm."" These are some of the things that people do in order to succeed though failure.

First, when people can not got something right the first time they can get emotional such as upset, mad, and frustrated and many more. An example of this could be when you are working on a math problem and you did not get the right answer the first time people can get upset. That is why emotions can be a part of failing to get successful.

Moreover, when people can not get something done they tend to just give up and do nothing. People should never give up because not everyone gets it the fist time. One example can be when you are trying to find information about an animal and you can not find anything on it so you just give up and not do the research information and now you are going to get a zero for it which is not good. This is why you should never give up even if it is hard for you

Although, most people have heard this saying ""third times the charm."" This saying has a meaning to it because it is telling you that you have to keep on trying in order to get it right. Sometimes when you keep on trying it can turn out better then the other times that you tried. One example can be when are drawing something and you do not like it you can try again and do it better then the first time. Keep on trying in till you like it or in till you get it right.

Not everyone has the same intentions as the people they hang out with.

You always want to know what are your own limits.

First, I think what he is trying to said with "" Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"" is always have big dreams bigger than you and have big ambition too.

It's important because you know what you're going to do or you know what you're going to see.

For example when my cousin went to another country she told me about her experience, and that puts a thought to my head of she did and what she saw. Therefore when i went to the country she went i experienced what she did and what she saw.

When your friends or family members share their experience with you, you start to imagine what they've expericenced and that sometimes leads to preparing because they've told you what they've experienced from them they can prepare you. For example your family has a thing where all the boys in the family try out for basket ball, and you ask your older cousin how was their experience went and what they did good and bad.

So you know what the coach wants to see and what he doesn't want to see that means you can show off to the coach and that can help you make the team and make your family proud and keeping the legecy going and when you can share your experienced with your brother when it's his time to shine.

Learning from others experience leads to good things like making a team,preparing,proving people wrong,improving, and some lead to bad things like you're new student and a bunch of girls see you're hanging out with a girlwho has had bad experience with them come up to you and tell you about their experience with the girl, and that makes you think she's so nice and that makes you not want to be her friend from ther experiece with her , or your best friend and you have the same science teacher but different blocks and your best friend tells you that the science teacher is very nice and when it gets time to go to your science class the teacher isn't as plesent as your best friend shared with you.

However, taking a online class would resolve those issues. Students would benefit from online education because there's no reason to miss school and to work in a better environment

Whenever a student misses a day or days of school they fall behind. They then have to do extra work to get all caught up. It causes lots of students stress and sometimes failure. Weather can also cause school to cancel. For instance, snow storms, or floods but working at home doesnt cause you to miss out on school. Students can never be absent in online school because everything is on a laptop. They will always be up to date with there assignments or exams. Students don't have to worry about being late to class anymore either. Instead, students will be stress free sitting on there bed learning.

Every student would rather be at home working then to be working in a classroom. Our own homes make us feel relaxed and clam so therefore, its a safe environment to work in. We don't need to do fire drills or lock down drills in our homes because we know our homes are secure. Also, when students are focus and working on assignments, the time goes by to quick. Next thing you know the bell rings and the students havent finished the assignment yet. Working at home won't make students feel rushed at all. Instead they'll have all the time they need.

Enjoyment can come from many things like getting a goal in a game, a hundred in a test, accomplishing something for the first time but there are many things that can bring joy in life. As you get older you learn new things, you get wiser but also you have more befits and disadvantages. For example, adults and older people have money and with money you can get things and spent it in anything you want and plus y'all can drive and go places and thats what people enjoy too. A huge disadvantage for adults is that they have to work for 8 or more hours but either way imagination never gets old but instead it gets newer. Adults and kids or teens however y'all want to call us but we are the same the only difference that we are younger but we all have a imagination awake or hibernating and thats what allows joy in peoples life even for the people that barely have it awake. Everyone needs to live life at its fullest being joyful trying new things like sports, music, or even puzzles but time is relative you stopping yourself because you think your getting old but thats not the case do everything you want to do before time runs out for you and you'll leave with regret but everyone need to wake up there inner kid inside of them and start living life without regrets try new things, talk to new people, spend more time with your parter or family etc. but make new memeries and be jolly and have such enjoyable life to new things you'll try.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.1831741,3.066588,3.327154,3.2598982,3.1644433,3.1359587,2.7395887,2.4779246,3.0201952,2.4681234,3.0899723,3.1215239,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,360,10,0.4944444444444444,36.0,6,10,"{'hibernating', 'befits', ""y'all"", 'enjoyable', 'accomplishing', 'regrets', 'joyful', 'smarter', 'disadvantage', '8'}"

When my group comes together, we all start giving each other ideas of our own knowledge to make the project successful. Although some may know more than others, but others may know things that some dont. I also like when my group shares ideas because are project can be much more creative. Some people may believe that someone working alone can also have as much knowledge than someone working in groups. However I believe that working in groups can benefit you on having more knowledge.

Getting together with my group makes learning fun. When we start the project every one would start concentrated so that when we get close to finishing we can talk to each other. People would quietly take a break and talk so that they dont get overwhelmed. . Although, some people may believe that being groups detracts and working alone does not. However, getting detracted is something you would choose to do and not something I would choose to do.

I always felt like being in groups time would pass really fast. In a group everyone would choose what they wanna work on or work on something they know more of. When everyone is working on something it reminds me of a job, because every job wants to make the job done as soon as possible. When time flies i feel good because the job is done and i get to relax. Some people may believe that students that work alone like to take there time and do there project at there own style and make it knit. However, I am a type of guy that likes to get my job done and quick, and I believe there is a lot of people that are the same type.

Students, teachers, and others employees have responsibilities in their houses and others places after school. Also, fathers can get a bad attitude about why theirs kids need to be ten hours at the school. Schools should not follow this model by extending the school two hours.

First, some fathers believe that extending the school by two hours their kids will get more stressed. For example, extending the school by two hours students will need to do more homework, test, and projects. Students can feel like they can not do all of the work what the teacher give to them. A lot fathers doesn't have a good transportation for can pick up their kids at the school that late. Therefore, schools should not follow this model by extending the schools by two hours.

Second, some students have responsibilities after school. For example, some of them have sports, drama classes, and jobs. Extending the school for two hours can cause that these students can lost their jobs or some hours, they can not go to drama classes, and can not go the their sports practices. For other way, students need to have some rest of all. Schools should not follow this model by extending the school two hours.

For instant, extending schools for two hours and four-day school, students can have three days free. Students can have more free time, they can hangout more with their friends, and they can have more rest. Consequently, with four-day school and extending for two hours students can get more stress, and their grade can go down. Schools should not follow this model by extending school for two hours.

Extending school for two hours, will cause that fathers will get a bad attitude, and some students will lost their jobs, sport practice, etc. Students will feel like they can not do it, and their grade will go down.

F99B20789DD7,"Dear Schoolboard,

I think that school should not be extended. students need to have a long break at home because they might have after school clubs to attend to.

I think students should not have extended school because they are not going to pay attention to the teacher they need to rest their brains for a long time since you are in school for 7 hours. Another reason why i think students should not have extra time at school is because kids have to wake up early and they are tired so they wont pay attention since they dont get enough sleep.

The other reason why i think school should not be extended is because the students most of them do not pay attention so typically the teacher is wasting her time trying to teach them. Also why i think they should not extend school is because if the day is longer they are going to need more breaks during the day and it takes a little long to go back in the building.

On the other hand i think they should have a extended school because they will know their subjects faster and that will make the school year faster. Another reason why i think they should extend school is because the students are really bored at home and they wish to learn instead of being home board. The last reason why

I think school should be extended is because kids might not pay attention during the day so with the extra hour they might want to pay attention and they will learn a little.

The last reason why i think school should be extended is because the students do things outside of home that are not good for them like doing challenges,steeling or getting into fights outside of school which can cause them injuries. The other reason i think they should extend school is because students would or will have a better education so that when they are grownups they will find a job that pays you more than the others.

These are the reasons why i think students should and should not have school extended i think they should extend school for a better education and i think they should not extend school because it is way too long",4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.4017453,3.3563893,3.3961358,3.4537487,3.4892938,3.4120727,3.8393104,3.528336,3.5669332,3.3519716,3.2854223,2.8600488,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,383,12,0.3446475195822454,31.916666666666668,2,4,"{'wont', 'steeling', '7', 'grownups'}"

If you mess up and make a mistake you will learn not to do it again. It's better if you make mistakes insted of being perfect because you can't learn and better yourself. We all make mistakes once in a while that's why we learn from them. You shouldn't let your mistakes hold you down. You should let your mistakes better you. Don't try to be perfect. If you do you will just end up never learning from an experince. When you make a mistake, adapt to how you can fix it and don't make that same mistake. This is one of the reasons why a problem is a chance for you to do better. Another reason is You learn not to make the same mistake twice.

You make a mistake and you learn from it. It's fine if you make another mistake just don't makr the same mistake again. If you make the same mistake twice you could get in trouble. When you make a mistake and learn from it you grow. Don't take a mistake as a flaw. You become wiser from a mistake. You become a better and smarter person. This is why a problem is a chance for you to do better.

The last reason is you improve yourself. You let yourself learn more instead of feeling like you can't come back after that mistake. Your mistakes become positive because you learn so much.

Others believe that praise given to deficient work undermines learning by lowering standards. They believe the source of true self-esteem is achievement. True self-esteem is from achievement, it encourages students reach their goals, being a good role model , and being determined for their success.

Students self-esteem comes from achievement, once one goal is achieved students will have confidence, which will cause students to achieve more goals. Students achieving their dreams will encourage others to try their hardest to succeed more. Students will become better leaders by encouraging others to accomplish their dreams as well. This will give students a mindset to not give up easily. When students see others achieve their goals it gives them hope to be able to do the same, which leads to students trying their best to turn in their assignments on time and give their full effort on topics they're given.

However, students having success allows them to be good role models for older and younger generations. Students prove others whats like to achieve their goals and have the emotional support they need to continue their dreams. Students set a good example on how others can accomplish their own goals. Students having confidence and helping others achieve their dreams helps build their self-esteem, which helps students learn better about others and ways to accomplish more goals. Being a good leader will help in many different ways to succeed by, helping others with emotional support and guiding them to their dreams. Students will be very confident when their goals have been accomplished and helping others to succeed as well.

In conclusion, Self-esteem comes from achievement. Students build their self-esteem by encouraging students to try their best on assignments, having emotional support, and accomplishing their dreams. True self-esteem comes from achievement, it motivates and encourages students to reach their goals. Self-esteem leads students to become a good role model.

Most workers may ask that and will be furious with technology because of the fact that they will have less work and probably less hours of work, since technology is taking over their jobs. it could also be said that technology could be taking over some jobs that require less work, which could be bad for the job environment because that means less job opportunities for people.

First, it could be rude to the staff that work their because of less human communication. How is it rude? Well think of it like this: someone is better than you at your job and you wanna be better, but you cant because the person you're going up against is a computer and knows mostly anything and everything on what to do in those situations. Most people may have to face the fact that you can't do anything about technology.

6B479AF72202,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote,''to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment''. Although some people disagree about Emerson's statement, actually I agree because society is always trying to make people change their point of view, their culture, their belivers. First never give up, Second always love and be proud of yourself and Third don't forgot your roots.

Here are some reasons why I agree with Emerson's statement. First, the world is trying to make change but you have to never have to give up. Becuase it's important to continue being yourself, not matter if some people are not going to like it, the only one who have to feel comfortable with yourself it's you. Second, always love and be proud of yourself. It's important to be proud of who you are because eventhough you make mistakes sometimes that doesn't have to make change who you are. You just have to learn from your mistakes, I know it is difficult but no one says that would be easy ,but you can do it. Love yourself because every of your features, your character and your personality is what identify you, is make you unique, different from anyone else in the world that wants you to fit on it. Third, don't forgot your roots. If you are from another country you are forced to change yourself, trying to pretend that you are someting else, but you must have to stop it. Because in a world that is constantly trying to make you be something else your biggest accomplisment is to show that you are better than what they expected you to be.

Finally what are you waiting for!. Don't let the world change yourself, remember to never give up always fight for is better for you, love and be proud of yourself always and don't forgot your roots because every part of yourself is what make you unique, special and that is your greastest accomplisment.",2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.137443,3.0824232,3.2624435,3.1969047,3.068882,3.0868607,3.2815888,3.0966725,3.5703127,3.3580077,3.4303784,2.4748583,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,344,15,0.3866279069767442,22.933333333333334,11,0,set()

Imagine your school cafeteria plans to change to a new, healthier school lunch menu, which would eliminate some of the students' favorite cafeteria foods. Many students wouldn't want to eliminate some of there favorite cafeteria foods. Therefore, I believe healthier school lunch menu you could benefit students at school, at work, and at home.

Dear, Dr. Generic_Name

My name is Generic_Name, I am a freshman at Generic_School. I would like to talk to you about a healthier school lunch menu. Ever since these 4 months have passed I've been eating the school lunch. Every time I eat the school lunch, after 30 minutes I would go to the restroom. The food wouldn't sit right nor feel right in my stomach.

The issue isn't just with me, my friend Generic_Name has an allergic reaction whenever he eats something from the school lunch menu. I believe it would be a good idea to have healthier school lunch menu. Because half of our students at Generic_School are obese. Even you know all the food your providing for us is junk food. The pasta has puddles of oil, the burgers don't taste like real meat, the orange chicken isn't even cooked well. All the food you are providing for us is microwaved food.

Instead of all these microwaved food. We could have similar foods as the ones we have right now for the lunch menu. The foods you feed us should be organic like the bread, meat , spaghetti , etc. The school lunch should be worth $3.75. Dr. Generic_Name instead of thinking about yourself think about us a little bit more. Imagine yourself sitting down at the lunch table seeing a puddle of oil on you're pasta tray. Imagine eating rock hard french fries. Please think about it and call me into your office if you ever want to talk about this issue that 75% of the students are having here at Generic_School.

However many people think that first impression are impossible to change, people can change their first impression, if they knows more about each other and if a person is passing by a struggling in their life.

People can change their first impression if they know more about each other, for example if a person that meet another at the mall they will have no time to talk about what they like to do in their free time because they has to make their purchases and my friend Generic_Name has a story with a girl that he likes, he said that was difficult to talk with her because that first time he talk to here was in the lunch line and she was hungry so she dont even pay attention to him, one day both of them have detention they star talking and meet more about each other, people can change their first impression if they give the according time to each person.

A person can fix his first impression if that person was no notified about what struggles was happened the other person that day, for example when the Algebra teacher meet Generic_Name, he said that Generic_Name was quiet because Generic_Name do not like talk to much, one day Generic_Name said that he just come from El Salvador and do not speak too much English and a person that has lost a family-member if someone tried to meet him on those days anyone will be said that he's must depress or sad because non of them know the truth. People can not judge other just in one day.

For decades people has been said that first impression are impossible to fixed. A person can change that first impression if they share about their hobbies, characteristics, and tastes and if that person was no in a good mood that day they meet.

I am very honored to write to you this letter and i pray you take time from your busy schedule and read this this letter .

i hope you are doing good as i am here.

i also want to say that i am happy to be a student in your school.

first of all i take a stand on your decision of changing the school food to a very healthier one and say it a very good one.

it's a very thoughtful idea , and it's also shows that you love the school and i appreciate you for such a great idea. it's a good idea because, half of the student have allergic reaction to some food the chief's cook so they rather go hungry or have an empty stomach and if such incident still goes on, student might even pass out one day.

secondly, if we get healthier food, we will be active and our brains will be able to function well as soon as class start. However, having a good breakfast or even any good food to begin your day sometimes help the brain to work very well , and it's also help make the brain be in a very good position of working during the day.

and not only does it work for the brain, it's also consist or contain some particular minerals like carbohydrate, protein, and fat and other supplementary substance that also help for human growth and also help give energy to the human body.

lastly , changing the school food will also will make student that has never tried the school lunch will now want to try it . Moreover, some student order food and have it deliver to the school all because they do not like the school food or allergic to certain food , and if such incident keeps happening, the school food will go waste and it's will make the school loose money.

so therefore, i will end my speech by saying that it's a very good and and a nice decision for having to change the school food to a healthier one .once again i hope you take time from your busy schedule and read this letter.

you can use or have your own car or you,

can take the public transport and go everywhere with out problems and if you want to go to another country you can! because the air lines exist now, and you can fly to go to the country you like.

So technology have a positive effect because is helping us to make our daily necessities at home or everywhere better, a reason why i think that is because the future of the students is going to be with more opportunities to learn what they like, with out saying excuses, the help of others is not going to be that necessary with technology in your hands; no body have to advocate for you with your problems and decisions.

Technology is going to be increasing, For example years ago you could not talk to your family or friends if they were too far away from you, in that edge the only thing you could do was write a letter and send it through mail and then the people who was waiting for it has to wait like one or two months; for have that note, but all that had changed too,

When the telephone was invented people start buying and using, that invent, for the public in general the telephone start to be necessary for the people for emergencies like call the ambulance or call the police in case that something dangerous could be happen;

years before, the history of the telephone became with new ideas like you can not just call with the telephone because is has be made it smart you can take pictures play read book and more, today the telephone have a drastic change is nothing like the old phone is something different. technology had changed our way to communicate and transport and a lot more.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,2.9071865,2.715074,3.0671318,2.8772182,2.704113,2.82775,3.5730581,2.964974,3.2388012,3.0779822,2.995361,2.7309933,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,380,5,0.4657894736842105,76.0,1,2,"{'accommodating', 'excuses'}"
58EF6CAF956B,"Do you want to know the reason why it is important to have someone who can share wisdom and experience with you? Well, I know there are a lot of reason. The benefit of having someone who shared wisdom and experience with you is that, people will show new things, you will get an opportunity to learn new things, and you won't feel like you are the only one who is experiencing this.

When my friend shared how she overcome being alone, because she couldn't speak English well, I realize that I can overcome being alone too. It was hard for me to talk with the other kids, because I was afraid that they will laugh at me, because I couldn't speak well, and then my friend says ""try to talk with them, otherwise you won't be able to speak with them,"". After that, she told me If I want to communicate, I need to be confident. Like that, She shared her experience.

The another benefit is that you can learn new things from the person who shared their wisdom to you. When they tell you about their experience, you will gain strength from it and you won't be afraid to do new things. When the people who tell you about their experience see you doing new things, they will support you, so that your experience will be memorable.

There are times when you feel like you are the only one who is experiencing this, but when someone tells you about their story, you will feel that you are not the only one who is feeling like this. When they shared their story, you will gain an opportunity to make new friend. You two will share your feeling about the experience and become closer. On the other hand, the funny and the sad stories will make you two have fun while you talk.

Since you know that there are a lot of reasons to share your experience, I wish you could use them to share your wisdom in the future.

Schools should extend time by two hours because students will have more time to do there class work. If a students have more time to do there class work then they will not have there class work as homework. Having more time in school means that you can get your work done and have extra time to do othere class work. In my old school we only had seven hours of school and we have eight classes in a day. most of the time we barley had time to finish ower class work so we had to finish it as homework. We also did not have time to do labs, expirement, and project. Thats why having more time can help us do all of those things. Another reason would be is that teachers will have time to explane to students things that they do not get. Teachers have time to explane things to a students and help them under stand more about what they are learning. In the movie Matilda students there only had six hours of school and teacheres did not have time to explane things to students. Students only went to school, tooke notes, and went back home. Sense they had no time at school to do class work they had a lot of homework. Most of them did not even finish there home work becauses it was to much. At the end of the movei students had took an exam and they had the whole six hours to finish it. When the time was up ninde persont of the students did not finished so they automaticly failed. if only they just had more time, more students would have passed the exam. Another reason would be that having more time can help students is that scientists prove that having more time added in a school schedual will help students incress there acidemic by ten persont. That means if i spend more time in school learning i will be come smarter then students with a regular schedual. Having more can help students finish work they would not normaly finish when they have a regular schedual.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0045524,2.9812753,3.1221776,3.0804803,2.9712992,2.8249378,3.3812165,2.941168,3.5143554,3.3107033,3.3740563,3.1100588,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,358,19,0.3854748603351955,18.84210526315789,19,4,"{'homework', 'smarter', 'exam', 'labs'}"
12920189F7BB,"Some societies may think that students are expected to identify a career by the time they reach high school. High school students shouldn't rush their selves to think about the career they want to accomplish. Most importantly they should stay focused on what's important which is education. Students have more than enough time to think about their careers, but not at this moment. They're too young to understand the reality that they're going to face, and the struggle that they're not expecting to happen. Which is why it's really important for them to stay focused on their education, than to suffer later in their lives.

To be honest, nothings wrong with thinking about your career, but it's not always healthy to think or stress about it all the time. Because it could cause an affection on your mind which isn't good. For students who first enter high school, should think more importantly about their grades and how well they're doing in school. At a young age students are fed in with so many ideas and careers that they want to accomplish in life. Their minds are too young to understand, so it's very important for mentors to help them realize that it's better to accomplish from education, than to suffer in the real world.

For example, high school students who work after school, never find the time to come home and focus on completing their school activities. Because of their job that's holding them back. As a student, it's commonly stressing to go through these types of stuff. In fact, no high school student should have to go through these type of things. They have a whole life ahead of them and have the time to think about their goals. So, it's very important for students to focus on what's important, and not worry so much about what they want to achieve or accomplish in their career. The goal to everything is education, maybe some day when students accomplish their ways in education, they'll probably achieve the career that they've been looking for.

DE0F5C13960F,"Have you ever wondered what it is like to have a homework club at your school, well its pretty useful. The idea is for kids to do their homework at school instead of at home, you can get help from a teacher and also work with your buddies.

One reason why I argue for school clubs to be available is because you it gives you time to do other stuff such as, spending time with your family,spending time with your friends,and even go to the movies. If you do your homework at the homework club you won't have to worry about due dates, quizzes, or tests. If you dont go the homework club you will always have tons of homework and not even do it which can cause your grades to fall down and probably not graduate if the required skills aren't meet.

Secondly, if you and your friend are in the same class and get the same homework then you can work on it together,check each others papers, and quiz each other on it. If you work on it alone you might get confused and frustrated, or maybe stressed, obviously copying one another does not make you learn anything, but there is a teacher who can help both of you at the same time.

Video games are very fun and addictive but you cant play if you got homework in the way. If you get you homework done then you have the whole day to play with your friends, communicate with them and even battle to the lat one standing. Some video games have blood, gore, and violence and some kids love those games which can be a small problem but not a big one, most parents can take devices and electronics away because kids dont do their homework so if you want to play video games and have fun you better go to homework club.

In conclusion the homework club should be available and going so that kids can finish their homework all at once and have fun in and out of school. Homework is really important and kids very often dont do their homework and thats probably the reason why kids hate school and do not want to got to school.

If I have a choice to choose one of them i think i will choice to go to school to know more people.

These are my three reasons on how students can do the online classes from their home.

The first reason is why students want to do the online classes from their home, because maybe they don't like the people from outside probably they think that all people are bad, they are not nice, mean, in respectful. Probably their parents doesn't want because they scared of how people are going to treat them or they are going to give them a bad influence like going in the wrong life. Or they don't want because her son/daughter are bad having some medical problems they think that the people are going to laugh at them.

The second reason is maybe other students don't like to a normal day of school they probably like to stay at home and taking the online classes from there, because they feel that people are not gonna like them or judging them sometime students don't want to go because maybe they have a medical problems because they feel embarresed or something bad happened when they were at school.

Finally if I choose one of them like staying at home or going to school i will choice to go to school because I will love to help people to explain them that why is important to go to school and giving a advice to them that they don't need to be embarresed if they have problems they just need yo let it go some people don't think if he or she are hurting the person who is bullying them.

First, People like to be idle with other people like in some works when they do not want to employed in his works just because they have a inability personal but if people want to accomplish. They can doing something like in his home or a thing easy that they can make, for follow living but some people something just think about what they want to make his purpose but they never do something.

Third, In some place or country are bad, because people do not accomplish to have a good country because they do not do something good, for example something steal person, and happen that country accomplish a purpose we need to accomplish what we can or what we what for ours life, and do not be idle because are idle do not help for make something better for ours life, so we need to have patience with want we accomplish.

We need to doing something good for examples, people that work in office need to be amiable with people that need something most of the people who work in office do not have to be idle. Also be a wonderful person in jobs like restaurant help to have more client but depend how the people serve. So first to all we accomplish more if we are always doing something for ours life and do not do bad things that do not help for what to accomplish so we need to think first the things and glide that things what we want to do.

A570CD64F0F9,"A single persons actions can change how other people act. Albert Schweitzer, a philosopher said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing"". I agree with his statement and believe it as true, as most people look up to and copy whoever is currently popular on social media. People also like to follow the example of what they are taught, by parents or teachers. In this essay, i'll be talking about how setting an example for others is the best way to influence others into doing something.

First of all, Watching someone do something that interests you could influence you into doing the same. For example: if you like food and you watch someone cook, it could possibly persuade you into making your own food. Most of the time, people would not do something without being influenced or persuaded by someone else. Take Juuling for example, most kids would never do such a thing unless being persuaded or peer pressured by their friends.

Secondly, Teaching someone to do good by an example is also good, as it sets them down a good path, just as most parents do. A person cant do something they were never taught or ever learned, so they look to other people who can do things; and look up to them. Only by setting an example can others follow. Much like a pack of wolves, the leader sets an example and rest follow it.

It could be argued that a speech or something of the sort could also influence people, such as Martin Luther King Jr's ""I Have A Dream"" speech. In the past that might have been the best way to influence people, but in modern day society a majority of people are influenced by action and examples. Otherwise, why would kids be doing these ""Challenges"" that you hear on the news every other day?

In conclusion, Examples are the best and most effective way to influence others into doing things. By setting examples, people are influenced into doing all sorts of things. Whether they are good or bad is completely subjective and depends on what the person is influenced into doing.

AB142AA123BC,"As we all know, students love summer break. but what if they were to take that long summer break we once had and make it into a 3-4 week summer break! I would be beyond upset and I bet other students will too! Personally I don't think it's a good idea. But who am I to judge other people's opinion's. So i'm going to just state some reasons why this not a good idea.

First Reason is that many students want a long break from school. And I mean a LONG break from it. The reason to this is because, we get stressed, tired, drowsy, and even suffer from all the studying and work we do year around. And this can cause depression in teens as well, and trust me I know that feeling it sucks. But anyways back on topic. And for the educators that said we should get longer winter breaks and spring breaks it sounds like a good idea but it just doesn't make sense to me in my opinion.

Second Reason is that students spend more time with family and friends! The reason for this is that students don't have time to spend time with them because the're either doing school work or the're to tired to even talk so they go to sleep early because of how tired they are. And when you are tired you feel grumpy and disturbed by everything so it's better off just going to sleep rather than talking to family and friends because, all your going to bring is negative energy and no one wants that.

Final Reason is that summer break is basically like a reward for students that made it through the year. A nice 3 months without work, stress free, relaxation, and do whatever you want and 3-4 weeks is not enough for us to be honest we need a good long break from it because we just need a little time to relax. And when September arrives it will be a fresh start and are minds will be clear and ready again too do more work. In conclusion these were my statements on why summer break should stay as it is.

most in one point is good bad in other point is not really good because when a student take the four year of high school is most be prepared, when someone took three of school is not on total prepared.

Most kids wants take three year but they don't thinking about it; they think is easily for them. Take time and thinking, most student who follow ths plan most don't take elective classes courses for the simple act that finish high school early then other students.

Kids who finish high school, in four year they're going with knowledged that they know better than other, some high school's have programs three year until two years to study, but in some high school's it is necesary make four years for wherever reasing or for that is traditional four years as well one motive is because student after graduate they will go to work they don't go to college and that's why they took three years.

For example one's of my friend's took three years and her sister took two years my friend's who took three yaars she said that her don't have the opcion to take elective classes for the simple reason that her will graduate in three years from high school. But when she took one career of college she don't what is going on, because one of her classes has nutrition wellnes and she didn't know nothing about it.

Her sister took two classes her only have three clases; crime, cooking, and goverment;

and her teacher says that her want the opportinity of wanted to comes night school for finish the three classes, but she graduate beginig of time, her graduated in march that normal graduate for us is in june.

898A8417D70E,"Do you know that 80% of students that goes to the after school program and received more extra help succeeded more than the students who didn't go? After school program helps students that needs more help to succeed, pulls up students grades, and they will have extra time to complete missing work and home works.

If a student wasn't available in a class and missed the class lesson;They would have the opportunity to stay after school with their teachers and learn what they missed and complete their missing work that they haven't done in class. Students stay after to study with their friend and teacher for the test and receive help on difficult lessons by that grades will increase for students that will make them succeed in the future. And it's a better way for teachers to explain the lesson without interrupting the class and make other students confused.

Having you missing work done at school might be hard to do in classes but by having the after school program you will have the time to complete them with your teacher and your friends and taking more help by asking the teacher about what you don't understand. Sometimes some students needs more time completing the tests or the quizzes so the only way to complete them is staying after so they won't lose points and grades.

On the other hand some students think that staying after is a waist of time and you won't receive any benefits, and some dont care if they have missing work or classes they missed ,but its all wrong staying after is a much better way for pulling grades up its a really big opportunity that teachers give their own time to their students by complete missing work, making the teacher explain the lesson again to the students to make them understand the lesson and what its talking about so they won't be confused or fail the class.

In retrospect after schools programs is big good opportunity that most schools provide for students to receive that extra help from teachers to complete what their missing to make students succeed in school and pull up their grades thats why we should persuade students to go after school for help, that's why I'm base with school programs.",4.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.2449474,3.0828998,3.3362322,3.2357693,3.1201787,3.2343614,2.8462245,2.601257,2.9175494,2.7071445,3.1134882,2.8780212,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,391,9,0.3861892583120204,43.44444444444444,5,5,"{'80', 'retrospect', 'quizzes', 'wo', 'interrupting'}"
82F9FDBD6F98,"My argument about the 10pm curfew for teenagers statement; is they should have a curfew for teenagers because it can get them out of trouble, and make it home safe and they can get rest for school.

Example of staying out of trouble is you can get mistaken at night; and get hurt just by not going home at the right time. Another example a teenager can be at there friends house and if they leave late or outside with there friend, anybody can be outside and would want to hurt them or there friend because it's dark out, but if you have the 10 pm curfew you can leave without worrying about being in trouble. also can have a guardian to pick you up when its late so this scenario would not happen.

Another reason is to get some good rest for school and have lots of energy. If you do not have enough sleep, but can have the 10 pm curfew to help you to get some rest and will also help you concentrate in school. An example for this is a teenager could be outside and they do not have a curfew so the teenager comes home late. And does not get good sleep or no sleep and goes to school tired and can't concentrate.

A good counter claim for both is you can just stay home and don't have worry about a curfew or going home really late. because if you are scared to go home late or can't get some rest just stay home. You will be more safe home with a guardian or sibling then outside in the dark and not knowing who is outside. And parents should just be more protective so they don't end up going home late. And they can stay home and sleep earlier and get lots of rest for school.

with both arguments i think the best for teenager is that they should have a curfew just for safety reasons. And no parents should be worried or scared for there kids being outside late because there city council do not have a curfew. And another reason is they can get good sleep for teenagers is very helpful for them so they can have a lot of energy and concentrate in class better and get good grades.",2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.1496532,3.0405688,3.219757,3.171949,3.1158683,3.1481533,3.4845831,3.3755324,3.2715433,3.6285453,3.198676,3.5966854,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,392,16,0.3520408163265306,24.5,5,5,"{'curfew', 'sibling', 'teenager', 'scenario', '10'}"

FDFB04ED3388,"I agree with John Lubbock statement about ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it""

because in order for you to get to your career , you want to have very good character traits. For an example , you love working with kids , so you apply working at a daycare center where you'll teach little kids the different types of shapes and watch them while their parents are at work. You apply and get schedule for an interview and the owner in charge looks over your resume and realizes you have bad character traits , do you think that they'll give you the job ? no they wont because they want someone who has good character traits.

Another reason , Your character shouldnt be decided by the world or your friends. Your character is something you show to somebody like loyalty and respect. If your loyal to someone chances are they'll be loyal to you. For an example a Hospital hires you to be a general surgeon most likely they want you to stay loyal to them and stay with them. Respect goes a long way , respecting someone is very important you never want to get in someones bad side because you never know what they'll do if you disrespect them. You want to always respect someone.

Your character is something that is chosen by yourself never the world, because you could be a very good person and you'll still have people talking down on you , but you choose to accept the fact that people are always going to have their own opinion. The world shouldnt decided if your a good person or a bad person society shouldnt decide that either. You choose to either be mean , rude , nice , happy , or sad. Your character shouldnt be based on the people around you. They shouldnt have to choose your attitude.

Even though people think that your character is formed by influences beyond our control , I think we control our own character , we choose to either to be mean or nice. We control what goes through our head and what comes out of our mouths. The people around us should respect our character. We decided what we want to do for ourselves not others.

I believe the appropriate use of technology does not divide, or limit human contact. If we give a good use to it, we will have great benefits. Besides, technology improves communication skills, helps parents, and facilitate jobs.

Research has proved that technology has been a useful tool for communication skills. This is shown in the facility that we have now at making a call, or video call to another country. It has improve communication for people who are speechless, defeat or just shy. All of them has problem at talking or listening, but with technology this is getting over. And they are interacting in certain way with other people. To sum up, technology is improving communication in different ways.

Parents always have many things to do. Passing time with their children is not easy; however, technology is making easier it. Now parents can work from home; this is giving them the opportunities to share more time in family. Also, for parents that work out new machines are helping them to finish quickly. Although, new phones schedule appointments and others for them, in order to be organize. In resume technology is giving the opportunities to spend time in family to parents.

In centuries before how many time does a writer spend writing a book? Technology has being a helpful tool for years; long time ago a writer spend one year writing a book by hand, now they just spend 3 to 4 months writing a book in a computer. New technology give us a lot of opportunities like:

We do not work all days, We get a good pay, and We do not work in the sun shy. In resume, technology is facilitate our life.

In conclusion, technology is a wonderful tool that let us develop our communication skills, unify families, and makes easier our jobs. People who does not have skill of listing or talking; they can still communicate their selves. families now are more unify. Jobs now are more easy.

people have different opinion about being ten hours in the school day. some people think it is a good idea for their kids to be ten hours at the school day. However, I believe that being ten hours in the school day it is not a good idea, because it dose not help for the energy and the resources, everyone's brain needs to take a break in the day and ten hours working in the school day is too much for a kid.

First, being ten hours in the school day dose not help in the energy and the resources; Because we spend the same amount of time at the school, But instead of spending an eight hours a day in five-day a week we will spend ten hours a day in four-day a week. so we are going to spend the same amount of energy in both.

Second, everyone's brain needs to a break. If we spent ten hours of our day at the school we are not going to be having that much time to live our lives, do our work and see our family. everyone needs to relax and sleep enough during the day to focus more and do more good at school.

Finally, ten hours is too much for a kid to spend in a day at the school. kids will dislike going to school. they will get tired. for example when my sister stay a little longer after school for extra work, she comes back home so tired, not talking to anyone and doing noting, because she is tired of being a little bit longer at the school.

In conclusion, as you have read. extend the school day two hours a day in four-day a week is not a good idea because it dose not help to conserve energy and the resources, everyone's brain needs to take a break in the day and ten hours working in the school day is too much for a kid. so what we can do is not extend the school day two hours a day, so all the kids can do good at the school, focus more and live their life happy.

You can't be successful if you're just going to idle. To be soemthing in life you have to work hard for it. You always have to push yourself to the max limit. But at the end it'll all be worth it.

I remember my mom always used to tell me that ""Never wait for tomorrow to do something that you can do today."" And that will be in my head for the rest of my life. I use that quote to motivate myself when I'm doing homework or going to the gym etc. It always works and i will always live to that. My whole family lives to that qutoe.

The world would be such a better place if people didn't idle. If people were determined to work hard for themselves, everybody in the world would be succesful. Also more people would be enjoying a more wealthy life. Less people wouldn't need a place to sleep. Their would be more people enventing stuff to make the world a better place. Everybody in the world would have water and food.

You would make your whole family proud. Give back to the people. Do unreal things that no human has ever done before. Maybe even go to every planet to see if humans are able to live there. Their would be less crimes and less lives lost. Also more opportunities for people to succeed.

FA63EE28501A,"Does true self-esteem come from praises or does it come from achievement? It's come from earning achievement, There's only so much praises can do if they aren't earning anything. Therefore the harder they work,the more they achieve. their self-esteem will keep rising and then they start believing in themselves more.

Also other believe that praises for deficient work undermines learning by lowering standards. I agree with there opinion,I believe that there should be goals to reach and you must try your hardest to achieve. Their's always the chance the chance of failing but that just means to keep pushing, to fix the mistakes. And when you finally achieve your goal it makes you feel so much better about yourself. Also that builds you up for harder task.

Therefore some believe that the source of true self-esteem is achievement. which I believe in too,feeling better about yourself works more when you have earned something. Also it can be anything but as long you give it your all,and achieve what is meant to be achieve. Your self-esteem is going to be built up knowing that you achieve something.

Next I don't believe in just praising someone no matter how good the job was works like that. Because you keep praising that they could do so much better on,it's just going to make the feel like they already got the job done,when they can do so much better. Praise their work when they tired there hardest,so then they can keep trying there hardest to achieve goals no matter what. That's how i believe that praising should be done and how to build self-esteem to make whoever try to best on anything, to not give just half but to give there all.

Finally does true self-esteem come from praise or does it come from achievement? It's come from earning achievement,so they know they give it everything they had to earn that achievement. praises work when you praise there best work so they can keep on trying there best on everything. It's takes them believing in themselves so they can earn achievement to build their self-esteem.

However pleople should make their own decisions and manage their ideas to do what they think is correct.

First, people should create their own ideas. although, they have to follow their instincts, and don't led anybody disturb their mind. Think on how they want to improve and try new things. Also seeking ideas from other people is not a very good thing when it won't benefit them. To understand what the role of life is, people should expand their ideas And work out more by themselves.

Second, people should make good decisions. In other words, people should decide what they really want. When people make good decisions they tend to be successful and encourage themselves to keep growing. Decide what people really want, and what can they really do, is very important, since not everyone is able to do what other people can do. Therefore, confidence is the key to make good decisions. We can also say that people need time to think about any bad consequenses that can result from any of their decisions.

Third, people will get more experince. In fact, people know more about life when their experience is greater. Experience will help people to know how to face problems whenever they make a mistake. Also, an important point of experience is that lessons of life won't led people make the same mistake over and over. Correct or incorrect decisions would make people more experienced. That's why, experienced peolple are more likely to success than not experienced peolple in order of the kind of knowledge that they have.

In conclusion, people as builders of their own life, should be independent, and don't wait until someone tell them what to do, and how to do it.

Becoming a model was my idea and something I think it will be better for me and nothing beyond that standard; was calling people for help, applying from one agency to the other but there was no help.

I actually agree with this, because some people are just stuck with what they do , and they don't want to try new things; they are just so used to what they have been doing for years, so they are kind of afraid of doing something new. It's just like making new friends in school. Kids are really used to their friends that they rarely talk to new students. This might apply to Ralph's words because some people don't really want to change their routine, or because they dont really wanna change their life style at all.

Another example but a little more personal would be me, I love riding my bike, I feel like I could ride it for hours without getting tired, I tried to do skateboarding for a couple months but I ended up going back to ride my bike, because I was already used to be riding my bike so I stopped trying to learn how to do skateboard.

I would say that it's like a feeling of being afraid because we think about it, we think about it's pros and cons and we also try to adjust our schedules to see if we have time to do something that's not in our routine already or if we can just replace it for something that we already know how to do. I feel that to succeed in life we have too be willing to try and or to do things that are new for us like a new type of sports, a new hobby, even a career as long as we are interested on them.

First, they will have more choices to choose due to this problem. Everybody will have a different idea because of their way to look at the problem, they might think the problem out of the box and give out some choice that you never think of. Recently, my friend Generic_Name were in a problem of what sport should he choose and we all gave out different opinions because some of us think that which sport can benefit our future better, some of us think that is important to match your hobbies and benefit to your body health after you play the sport, but we never think about the sport that Generic_Name like better. It is important to think the problem in a different way because after that you can find a better way to solve it .

Second, seeking for multiple opinions can help you collect ideas and solve the problem with friends and family. It is important to think together with friends and family because it can help you with more ideas and power. Recently, my friend Generic_Name got bully in school two moths ago, Generic_Name cry in the restroom alone because the person that bully him told that

Generic_Name cannot tell anybody about what happen, after he get home he told his parents and principal start to find out the person bully Generic_Name. After that, Generic_Name know it is very important to let parents know that his feeling.

Third, seeking for multiple opinions can let people feel like they are not alone to this problem, most of the time people can cause the mind to do wrong things because they feel like no one want to help them and leave them alone. Recently, Generic_School did a report that said three percent of people died in the year is because they feel alone, they think that no one with help them. If everyone can also help each other when they have a problem, maybe we can make the world much better.

Spending time outdoors with your family and friends is like having a camping day, is there is a river that you are allowed to fish, it will be a great idea to go fish and catch some fish to eat them, but the most important thing is to have fun with all your friends and family. To admire how beautiful is the nature, to forget all your problems while listening to the sound of the birds reconnect with you family and to remember how important is to the love of your family and friends, Because some people don't have family and friends and there are all alone that's why is so important how much the people around you that appreciate you so much and you have to be so thankful for that.

Also with school apps we can email our teachear. Students think thats one good reason to use or phones with education.

Cellphones are small and they still have it all. Rigth now students are using computer wich it harder because it makes our backpacks heavier, why dont we replacet them for a phone. Its beneficial for us. If we the students could handle a computer, we can handle a phone. Some people think that migth be a good option.

Cell phones have more facility to get into stuff. In cell phones everithing its abvaible, that means we can found a lot of stuff.. Definitions, apss, movies about education ect. To be abvaible to everithing its something beneficial for us. .Sometimes we need to watch and old movie and the teacher dont find it but if we have the cell phones everiyone would watching it separly. Cell phones are a good thing for the education.

Theres people that think that cellphones are a bad thing to the education. They think its not rigth to have a phe out in class. Some people think that cell phones are too avaible. They think they are distractive. They think its not the same think as a computer.

we see the two parts of this, one part its showing that we need phones and they are easier for and the other part its showing that they are a bad option. We

B32F41984B27,"Here is my three reason why student should not go online do the classes work at home.

My first reasons:student should not do there classes from home.

Because it can be hard doing you work at home it batter do the work at work because you can get help by the teacher at home no one can help you. It can be hard to do the work from online because you don't know what the teacher can gave to you i will rather do it at school because it will be easy to do the teacher can help you with it will be hard try to do you classes work online at home.

My seconds reasons:student who are smart should do there classes online at home.

Student who pass the SOL and the class they should get out early from school because people who have a job they should get out early from school. Student should have a high GPA so they can find a collage they want to be they have to think what they want to be when they finish high and collage so they can have there own business person and make money. People who is smart should not go to school because they already pass every they did.

my third reasons:They should make classes work online only for the kids.

Because it will be easy for them to do they classes work online. They should make classes online only for kid it will easy fro them do it it at home batter then school but some parents they want there kid to go to school and do the work at school. If they school do classes online for kid it will be easy for teacher and for the kid.

My finial reason:For school offer classes online at home.

I think all high school student should have classes online at home because it will be easy for student and for the teacher. If student have classes work online at home they can copy from his friends that why is not good to have classes online. Middle school should have a classes work online at home.

Collage should have online classes becuase it will easy for them do complete the classes online at home they will have time to do it and get a batter garde so you can complete the classes and take a new classes when you get A or B.",2.0,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.5,2.5860043,2.4902692,2.7134845,2.5063405,2.3951588,2.525908,2.5451279,2.4555101,2.3097448,2.1371033,2.027252,2.7494159,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,411,17,0.2895377128953771,24.176470588235293,4,5,"{'finial', 'fro', 'online', 'sol', 'batter'}"

I disagree that school should be more than eight hours because teachers can not manage their time, all staff will get tired, and some student have to take care of their family.

Teachers can not manage their time. For example, my math teacher Generic_Name he has another job he won't be able to manage his time between teaching the student and the other job. On the other hand, most teachers have kids and they send kids to baby care and they pay money. For example, my science teacher Generic_Name she was not able to stay after school because she has kids. Imagine you have make up work that needs to be done but your teacher is busy?

All staff will get tired. Imagine teachers, students, and people who in the cafeteria how they get tired if we make this decision? For example, I feel bad about the people who clean the cafeteria each day. All teachers will have hard time to explain to the student. For instance, I have my cousin he lives in Turkey. Their classes is about two hours and half. My cousin told me I have hard time to understand the teacher on the end of the class because he get tired.

Some Student have to take care about their family. For example, When I came from Iraq my mother had heart problem so I have to take care of her each day. My mother she was not able to cook and stand I was responsible to do that. However, when I was in my country I was responsible about my nephews as well.

Some say extending school hours is hopeful for student. They are wrong because some student don't like school so they will drop out. Some say student will have finish the school early. They are wrong student will be rushing and not able to get the lesson from first time.

It could also help you out with other situations through out life. This is why you should talk to more than one person when asking for advice, you can get other peoples opinions, the way others understand your situation, you can see situations differently.

When you talk to more than one person to ask for advice you can get other peoples opinion. Everyone you know thinks differently. Sometimes people may have some of the same thoughts but not every situation has the same solution. What one person has to say is different from what another person says.

People understand things differently. Some people you talk to will not understand your situation. They will not see the situation the way you see it. If they do not completely understand your situation they could say the wrong thing. When they say the wrong thing it could make your situation a lot worse. You should always have multiple people you know you can trust and you could talk with to ask for advice in any situation. While others will know exactly what to say and do because they probably have been in situations like yours.

You can see other situations differently. When you talk to more than one person to ask for advice you start to see things differently. It changes the way you think about any situation. You will have an open mind and you will know what to say when other people ask you for advice. Knowing what to do when other people ask you for advice can help you out with a lot through life. It can help build stronger relationships and people can trust you. Trust is very important because people can talk to you about anything and you will know how to react and what to say.

I think that if you talk to more than one person for advice it will hep you more .One time i saw this quot by Lebron James that said if you need advice always ask more than one because one person could be right and the other could be not be right so dont be scared to ask more than one person there is noting wrong about asking the person you look up to. it will most likely be better if you ask multiple people for good advice.

If you are a person that does not like taking to other people you can just go to one person or you can try something different and ask someone else but if you just want to ask one person you have to go to someone you trust so they can give you some good feed back and good information. If i was to ask someone for advice i would go to a person that is very wise and makes smart choices so they can help me make a smart choice so i dont make the bad choices. If you need good advice make sure your going to the right person because you do not to be getting bad information if you have bad information you can make some bad choices.

Getting advice from one person can also be good because what if your telling them personal thing they can keep it a secret but if you tell multiple people your personal information can get out there and can start getting bulled and you would not be able to trust anyone again so that is why sometimes you just have to tell one person if it is important information. And if you just dont trust anyone you can just go to your consular because your consular will never share your information with anyone and she will under stand you more because it could of happen to her as a child so one person can also be helpful.

Dont forget asking for advice can always be useful if its one person or it multiple people it can still help you but if it is a person that does bad things and you ask him for advice he can tell you to do the things he does and you will turn out just like him so do not do to someone for advice if they dont make good choice. advice can change pepole live if it is good.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,2.5,2.858651,2.834993,3.0309334,2.9585626,2.9164655,2.8177996,2.2888734,2.6986525,2.9848301,2.7925036,2.8104281,2.098676,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,423,9,0.342789598108747,47.0,5,3,"{'bulled', 'hep', 'consular'}"

I think that cellphones should not be allowed in the classroom because students dont do the work that they suposted be doing and schools already have tecnology to use.

Cellphones shouldn't be allowed for educacional purpose because students dont do that work that they suposted be doing. Sometimes students take pictures of homework or a test and then they pass it to a friend. They always wants to check theirs social media like snapchat or instagram. this in one reason why students fail classes or fail grades. For example, in my English class there is a guy who is always using his phone, checking his social media or checking his messages that his friends has be sending to him and he is not passing his classes.

Also, cellphones shouldn't be allowed for educational purpose because schools already have tecnology for students can use. The government gives the schools computers because they wants the students graduate and dont have any distraction by using theirs cellphones.

schools have computers or ipads and thas why teacher dont need to let the students use their phone to do any work that they have to do.

However, Students can do their work in the computer where the teacher can be checking what the students is doing, if his doing his work or not.

Some students might say that they can use their cellphones in the classroom because it is more easy for them to translate words than be looking words in the dictionary. Also, some students might say that they can't live with out using their phone. Finally, they might say that using theirs phone can be more easy because they can be checking their work any time that they want.

In conclution, I think that cellphones shuldn't be allowed in the class room. students have to learn how to live with out their phone because graduate and not fail classes is more important than be texting their friends all the time.

You can get more info on the topic you are doing. Like for one person can tell you one thing and a other person can tell you something else. Thats how you can get some more info. It helps more by asking more people because while you have your info they have there info as will. So then you can have more knoallige about whatever you doing.

I will argue that, we should choose our own characters by traits and not by influence. I think that we should choose our own traits, because we will be choosing our own fate or destiny, we shouldn't let other people decide our path and make a good character of yourself

Your character is your fate or destiny to choose on what ever path you should take. We all know that we should go to our own path to life and choosing what is best for our lives. You are the only one that can take control of your character and nobody should have the ability to take it from you. The fate or destiny is at the power of you hands and you are the only one to decide on what trait you will have on your character.

Don't let people decide on what path you should take and live with it. We should choose our own path to life and enjoy it. Many people know that we should be yourself and nobody else, we should be the character we choose to be. We all have our own character, we shouldn't influence people because you think that it is better for them. We shouldn't do that to other people because it was great for you, let them decide on what path they're going to take. We should only give them advice, but don't decide for them.

Make a good character of yourself, don't let anyone make you feel down. We are the ones to decide our own path of happiness. We can be many things if you believe that you can achieve it. If you think that this is a better way to a good character, then take it, endure it, make it worth it.

In conclusion, we should choose our own character traits. You might say, ""I think people's influences can be good for our character."" you are not wrong, but not all influence can be good for your character. It is what John Lubbock said,

""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it.""

2A9FC8634742,"What does it feel to achieve a high score on an English test after you study all week for? Pretty good right? You feel like all that sacrifice and long hours of study were worth it. All the confidence you build up was because of your own work. True self-esteem comes from achievement. Students and famous artist show us that without hard work, there is no true love for ones self.

First, school is the environment where students learn. In this building students especially show that in order to feel good and confident you work for it. For example; when playing a sport such as soccer, the athlete need to believe in itself to be an outstanding player and for his teammates to trust him when making a play. If the player does not believe in himself, his teammates will not chose him to guide them as the captain or simply as giving passes with the ball.

Continuing, a famous artists in the music industry named Lady Gaga show that when you believe in your passion and you give all of you in an scenery, the feeling of comfort and satisfaction is more than words. Gaga could not be where she is right now if people would have been sorry for her and just give her a contract without talent. In order to success you have to yourself and that's what she did, she develop her talent and now she is the most successful female artist in the music industry with ten gramys and many other recognition.

Contrary, some teachers agree that in order to build self-esteem students need to be commemorated for effort even if the work is not excellent but, why should students get recognition for not making their best effort? This would be unfair for all of the students that work hard for that test score. Feeling sorry for a student is not going to make them successful in life.

To conclude, all the hard work you put in a sport or your passion is going to help you succeed in life. Students are capable of so much and if a teacher praises an alumnus for work that its not worth a good grade, students will feel like they have not done something right and instead of building their self-esteem you would be creating an under qualify teacher or president. Is that what you want for their future?

In my opinion I think it would be great for the health of the school and student to have a healthy food during school hours, one main reason is bacause it keep our body,healthy strong in which we can reflex our education, It will benefit all the students mainly the ones that are in PE class,eating healthy can improves more day of life and better human body, eathing halthy can prevent you from disease and probably some virus.

by eathing healthy you will not only will be able to be on a good fit you can also feel good and with feeling good about your self means more thant anything in this world, my opinion about this i agree with this change and i would like to see more plans for the upcoming futre years.

every plas have good and bad opinions many student at school have said and have their own opinion, Many of them dont like to eat halthy they just wnat to eat and enjoy their life at the fullest, which is reasenable and i undestand they point, we all know that the food that make our body get fat and get worse is the bad type food but we all love that kind of food, is delicius and it taste great for example pizza, hamburgers and all those kidn of food.

To keep a balance and for the students to be better and feel better about them self i think it will be the best to have a schedule of food for example :monday healthy food, Tuesday bad food...

In my opinon i thik it will be the best for our students and for everyone in the school to have a healthy food schedule that way we can be happy and satisfy with our body.

But like John Lubbock says "" your character will be what yourself choose to make it"". I agree with John Lubbock because is important that you have to choose what will be your character traits and this are my reason. Firts reason is you create your own personality. The second reason is the you are not monotonous. And the last reason having others people respect.

When we create our own personality is means in a group of friend we are the funny, the serious, or the person the never pay attention what the other friend is saying ( that is me I never pay attention what my friends is seaying). Have your own personality is important because that is what make you unique when don't permit the other people influeneces with idea.

When a person is monotonous is they don't a different way to do the work they always is going to do the same every single thing for example in art class the teacher make a painting of a sundown and then they have to the same painting all the student is gonna put their own style to the same painting but this student is make a replica of the teacher work he don't put a different style or a different color.

Some people may says that be differentof the other people is no important.

Well get respect from the others people with your personality can be healthfull because when you are good leader the workers respect you and they work more and if you still confesed well let me ask you if you work with boss the is always angry and he is always yell you will be confortable to work ( I don't belive) or your boss is always making jokes you know to be ""cool"" you will respect him (I don't believe).

7E48A7A7B400,"When I was in elementary school, I've always wanted to have art lessons. Art is the lesson that I would like to share with elementary school students because it could help them in several different ways.

The first way art would help the students is by making them more patient. When you are doing art and using paints, sometimes you have to wait until it dries so you can add more details and etc, that is one way that art can help them be more patient. You have to be patient when you are making realistic drawings, because if you draw fast you might forget to add important details and the drawing may not come out as good as it would if you had drawn it with patience. Another way that it helps the students being patient is that they also sometimes might have to redraw it if the drawing does not come out as good as they thought it would, and that requires patience, especially if make a mistake when you are about to finish it. And also, when they are working in groups they might have to explain for the rest of the group what are their ideas and how they want to do the project, which also requires patience.

The second way art would be important to students is by making them more creative. When you are making art you have to be creative and think a lot. Being creative wouldn't only help them at school, it would also help their future. For example, if the student dream about their future, then it would help them to think more and be creative about what they want to do. Being creative would help them in several ways.

And lastly, art would help them be focused. When you are drawing you have to focus on what you are doing. If you lose the smallest bit of focus, you can make a mistake and might have to do everything again. Being a more focused person would also help them in life. And also, they woul need to focus in the directions when doing their work.

In conclusion, art would be helpful in several ways, It would help them to be a patient, creative, and focused person. Art would help them in life and school. It would help their future.

It's more beneficial for students work in groups because they can share they ideas. For example, if the students are doing a important project or a simple homework they all can says theirs opinions.

If students works in groups they can learn from the people in the group. First, if a students need support or not understand the class material other people from the group can support them.

CBFD5CD8BCD9,"Yes, I believe curfew can keep citizens out of trouble by limiting how long they can stay out of their homes. It can improve the city in the process of making the citizens feel safe.

City council should adopt a curfew for teens. Curfew keep teenager from staying out for too long and helps them catch a midnight rest. It balances the world and helps teens managing the time they work in between their jobs and regular daily activities like a midnight jog. Curfews helps them plan to head home early because we dont know what may happen during the night. I love to have a limit on my time because I may lose track of time and be out for longer than I need to be.

Adding a curfew the city is a good choice keeping the citizens safe while improving the public law for less of a death potential. It wont go well if we dont get a curfew and I will explain why.

If we dont get a curfew things will be problematic. Everyone will be staying up late making noise and traffic comes as often while people will just do crazy things. Its important that the city needs a curfew so it keeps the citizens in check and makes sure that no one is up late who might be doing some illegal activities. Staying up all night is bad cause it doesnt help the brain function for u to gain strength for tomorrow. It makes you fatigued and dysfunctional as well as can make you miss important events in life as u go on restless. It is sad to see the amount of car crashes when people drive even though they didnt get enough sleep compared to drunk driving is another story. You can set a curfew for yourself to be safer and more energized for the next day because the early bird gets the worm.

Having a curfew isnt a bad thing. Its an mandatory rule that will helps u live longer, be healthy and keeps u awake for the next day. The earlier you go to bed the more awake you'll feel in the morning since u set a curfew for yourself. I personally set one for myself so I could can be ready to take a test and do my assignments as Im up and at em.

The first reason why I think wokring in groups is more beneficial is because more than on brain think better. More then one person can help on what they are working on. They can help each other on what they need help on. Four people in a group can get things down faster then only one person. People in groups have less to do then one person because in a group everyone does something and being by yourself mean you have to do everything on your own. You also get more tired if your wokring alone and in a group your talking to one other and discusing what you are going to do.

Another reason why I think wokring in gourps is more beneficial is becuase you can learn something new from another person and if your working alone you only have what you know. In a group you come up with more ideas and support them if you think they are right or wrong. If you work alone you get stressed out and if you work in a group you know what you have to do and thata the rest of your group is doing, but if they need help you can help them out on what they need.

My thrid reasaon why I think working in a group is better is becuase you can support other people ideas and oppinions on what they think is better on the work. They can have a better idea then you do and might work better on the job. If you wokr alone you only have your ideas that you think are good but if you work in a group someone could have a better idea or oppinion.

If one has the knowledge he can accomplish anything. I wanted to learn how to make a dog house. I had no knowledge on how to build a dog house. My friend had told me that the school was having a science fair and that they were giving knowledge on how to build a dog house. I went and I had got the knowledge that i needed.

I think that if I get this job I will take It and learn from it ,so I would like to see the manger to see if he approves of It.

I would also want to go to a good collage to get the education to be a nurse. It is going to be hard to get this job ,but I am going to work for it as hard as I can. I also have to put in a lot of effort into this job to get it. It would at least take me about four years to be in a collage to help me study about how to be a nurse. Being a nurse will be difficult in a many ways, but it's a matter of learning of how to do something. I would say its a better idea if I study longer it would be a most likely that I would get the job.

More ways to be a nurse is by being organized because you need to know what the students need to become a nurse. Also I would need to listen to directions because you can mess up because it's an important job. There are a lot of pros and cons about being a nurse because it's a job where you can mess up you can get into serious trouble. It takes a lot of time to be things that you want to be ,but everything takes times ,so I would say being something that you enjoy and think if you can do it.

B76C582FA08B,"Some schools use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes. But are students really doing educational purposes? Should students really use their phones in their classrooms? Are students actually getting education? This is what I think about cell phones used in classes.

Most students get distracted by using their cell phones especially in class. I feel like every school should at least have laptops to give out for their students. It's more easier and less distracted. Because a lot of websites are blocked. Everyone gets distracted I know but thousand of teen are obsess with their phones. And if you're a teacher and let your student do their

""work"" in their cell phone, just know they might not be doing their ""work"" in their cell phones.

Some students might care more about their education then the things that's going on in life. Maybe not everyone feels the same, thinks the same, are the same. They might be capable to use their cellphones without getting distracted. Most of us can handle the distracting than others.

Most teachers actually let their students use their phones and don't really pay attention to their students. It might be our responsibility to be on track. But i feel like the teachers should at least stop us from getting distracted. Most students do get mad at teachers when the teachers stop us from using our devices. But do students know it for our own good.

When my parents take my phone away. I feel more free, relax, I feel good to be honest. I do get a bit mad at first. But then I think why they took it and how many time I lost. I feel like i'm back in reality and just leaving my moment god gave me. Honestly cell phones had ruined many peoples life's. Even toddlers these day all they do is come back from school and play on their parents cell phones or their losing sleep to watch videos .

I honestly don't think cell phones are healthy at all not even in education. Teachers shouldn't let their students use their phones at all. Only if it's in an emergency.

AD19BF721C0F,"Dear Principal of Generic_School:

The change of the menu at the cafeteria might be a good idea but also might be a bad idea for some students, the idea to have a new menu at the cafeteria should be made it first in a debate with all the students at the auditorium, students can have the right to vote if they would like to have a new menu at the cafeteria, they might give a vote for which kind of food can be remove and which kind of food should to stay, or they can decide if will be better to not make a change at the cafeteria, making this plan will not have any impact in students or school to choose they food or making a change because they will have the opportunity to decide what is good and what is not good for them.

Making this plan, students will feel comfortable to decide good things for their school, students can also share ideas with you and make different plans for a good change at the cafeteria, just think about it and you will see good results in students of your school.

If students decide to have a different menu of food...

""This might be a great idea for student to try different kind of food and make this change every year, the good thing about making this is that student will not feel tired for be eating the same kind of food every year.""

""Students will feel excited every day to go to the cafeteria and see the new menu of food at the cafeteria.""

""Some students might have a favorite food but they can try different varieties of food and have new favorite food.""

""Also will be a great idea to give 35 minutes of lunch instead of 25 minutes, students can share time with them friends, have more time to finish if they have any work class or homework to do.""

""Students can enjoy the free time to eat with no rush. Making a change will be an idea that all might students they'll support it."",

I hope you consider this idea as a good idea and students may consider it this as a good idea too, also think about the good change that you can make for students to have better time at school and enjoying they lunch will be great to fill they energy and get back to class.

Introverts can easly feel identificated with Waldo's words, in a world where the majority goes in the same diretion trying to convince themslves that the way they are taking is the best, it is just a fantacy, but sadly unique, and genius people are afected by the same.

As time passes most of us we still refusing to be like the rest of society; I trully belive that being yourself is more importar than a life lacked of happiness.

As we growing up we been told how to be, and who we have to be like, but only people who resists and face world's opinion can really know deeply what self-acceptation is. It is not about ego, it is about reallity. God, Universe or whowever gave us life, also gave us a purpose. Being different is not a crime, but a privilege, so we have to take advantage of it. Life has a lot of perspectives, just because they are right, does not mean I am wrong.

Before my favorite artist passed away, he used to say: ""I rather to be hated for who I am, than be loved for who I am not."" well, I think Emerson would love this quote. People that choose a diferent direction are usually called: black sheep, weirdos, misfits, and even crazy.

C41DFE052637,"Imagine someone is doing the same skill that he already has mastered, he is going to stay in the same place. He will never grow. One reason why doing different things can help someone grow is by being stronger in other things. Being able to learn new skills can improve your ability. Someone can even find out if they are good at other things that they probably never thought they would be good at. Is the best to try to do new things than staying in the same place and never growing.

First reason, why doing different things can help someone grow is by being stronger in other things. Being stronger in other things can really put you to the top where you never thought you could be at. When getting stronger at other things it could make someone the best athletic person or the best person that is strong in so many things. When being strong or good at things, you can even help your friends if they are struggling. Once you become a strong person are you going to be able to do anything.

Next, being able to learn new skills can improve your ability. Learning new skills can help someone out a lot. When doing a lot of new things it can make someone a healthier person. Someone is going to start realizing their improvement and once they start seeing results, they are going to start getting motivated even more. When someone knows so many skills, they could probably teach another person that wants to be like you. Is a great thing to be able to improve your ability.

Finally, someone can even find out if they are good at other things that they probably never thought they would be good at. Finding things that someone never knew they could do will make someone pretty shocked. When someone finds out more things that they are able to do, it can help them join in more activities. The people that can do more, they have a better advantage because they can do more that others can't do. Its pretty shocking that there are people that don't know that they could do something that they never thought they could do.

In conclusion, someone can make themselves even stronger than what they are now. When learning new skills it can make your ability improve. Also, someone can even find out new sports or skills that they never thought they could do.

F89738650EDF,"Self-esteem comes from achievement. My reason for saying this is because you shouldn't be getting praised for a low assignment that they did; then they are not going to grow. My other reason was that teachers are here to help students improve and if the student know they didn't the best they could've and get praised for it; then they're going to think that they don't have to do that much and will have a low self-esteem.

To elaborate more on my first reason for why I say self-esteem comes from achievement is because if you do excellent on a paper and are positively sure you did amazing then you should be getting praised. That shows how much a student can have a high self-esteem for themselves. Even though, the paper probably wasn't easy that person didn't get lazy. They wanted to do better which means that they want to grow and improve not just stay where they are.

I am going to explain my second reason for why self-esteem comes from achievement. This is all about the students and how they improve. Therefore, if a student knows they could've done better on an assignment and get praised for the lazy work that did then they are going out think that they don't need to do that much work anymore. Although, as the teacher; they shouldn't be praising students on lazy work. They should pull them aside and say "" hey this was good but it wasn't you best work; I know you can do better"".

My counterclaim is teachers shouldn't let students get away with lazy work. I say this because sometimes some students might think that the teachers don't pay attention to them or they don't care about their work. Even though, if the student approaches the teacher with a problem then the teacher will remember you and know to check up on you when it comes to your work.

In conclusion, true self-esteem does not come from praise on an effortless assignment. If you praise students on a low assignment then that's the level they are going to stay at because they got praised to be lazy. Which means that the teacher leaves the student not wanting to improve and expand on their writing skills.

DD00E48BC258,"Honestly, I do not agree about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. The pursuit of success in life is achieving it in many ways.. Therefore, you can push yourself to be successful by putting in effort.. Failure can lead to serious conflict because then you will not be able to succeed. The important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success is not agreeable because you can overcome obstacles, aiming the goal to success, and to achieve the plan to .success.

First reason, is to overcome the obstacles, for that you must have to work hard. Also, it takes practice the better you get to succeed. Do not give up on something you are overcoming in life. One of the biggest problems that people have in life is not overcoming what they are afraid of and from being afraid will not get you to succeed. Most of all to overcome the obstacles. is to try them not to give up on them.

Second reason, putting a great effort can lead to improving. Efficiently the work you do can increase a great impact towards your achievements. In order to achieve a method, working pays off and by earning it. For example, people push themselves to making progress. Others might work hard in different ways to be successful and to aim what they want. Eventually, when making progress towards something, can influence the goal your improving.

Third reason, to plan the success is to try achieving what your aiming for. In other words, enthusiasm can be those people that want to be successful in life. Pursuit also aims for the goal your trying to influence. When planning goals, is the most valuable thing to achieve. There must always be a plan towards the target you aim. Majority of the people, look for something easy they can achieve in their future goal and that is how they succeed.

Finally, the key to being successful in life is by achieving it. To be honest, I do not agree about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of improving. Many people find success by putting in effort and time towards big things. It is not to late to start pushing yourself to be successful and being something in life.

The students may have to reschdule some of the things that may have to do after schools end and some student can't changed there schdule at all also more stress can happen to the students.

Some student have things to do after school like they have a jobs go to after school ends, I have a friend that has a job he go to after school end and to go right away or he will be late for work that can lead to him fired. I have art school after schools ends and I need to be there on time to finish part of my art work that help me get in to college. Some of the student may have go to an importent event that has a time on it like a funeral in a diffrent state and that can lead to get behind in class work.

More work may over stress the student mind and they might fall behind in things that might be inmported, the student may have less time to sleep to get work done on time beacuse there schdule maybe get more cramp with work to do, then they were before the school have added one more hour of school day. And the classes may have more work to do in class that can lead to more stress to the students and more homework to finish off at home.

C77A361A7476,"Is it good for students to to finish high school early?. Students should be allowed to take classes early because they do all their work in time , they take classes over the summer or even after school. They also get to go to college faster. They also get to walk and get there diploma faster. The student get's to go to college to study for what he wanted to study for.

The students who study harder or finish the work they do should be allowed to finish school in three years. If they study hard and take extra classes let them fish early. That's all up to them , if they care about their study let them walk early. The student put's his or her mind set to finish school early witch is great for them. The student who finishes school gets more time off of school. But at the same time more stress on them.

At the end of the day the more students that finish school early have one full year of no school. They get to focus on what they wanna go to college for to study. But that's only some schools, some schools don't even allow students to finish school in three years. In some schools they make you do the full 4 years of high school. Some schools probley want the students to do the the full 4 years of high school because they probley need a class on 12th grade.

If some schools let some students finish in the 3 years then the school wont be as packed. The schools need more space cause of more students coming in. They need to have more space and it would be less work for them. But at the same time it would take some time off the teachers. Some teachers have the time to help students and some don't.

Welp that's all have to say about schools letting students finish school in three years. I really think schools should let students finish early because they work hard to get there.

If the student finishes his or her work they should be allowed to walk early. I think that all schools should allow all the students who want to finish early to let them.

People don't have to be something else as a greatest accomplishment. People are not being themselves in the world. This quote is not true because people are not achieving their goals, they are trying to be someone else, and they are not being about themselves.

The're not achieving their goals if the the world wants them to do something. People need to achieve their goals without someone telling what to do in their life. They have to know if they if the goals right for them to achieve, People with goals often don't like their goals because the world wants them to be something else in their lives. Often times people mistaken for want they want to be versus what they don't want to do. People who are not achieving their goals they go to be something else because they don't have a goal, or they are not themselves.

People are trying to be something else in their life by being not themselves. People have tried being themselves but failed because they can't find themselves. The majority of people will be something else rather than then be who they are inside of them. The world is a big place to be in for people and they don't want to express themselves out in the world, so they try to be something else to fit in. The majority of people who are something else are not happy for their decision because they are trying to hide their real self.

The majority of people are not being themselves in the world because they are not happy about themselves. People don't want to express on who they are in the real world and hide themselves. People are not showing who they are out in the world.

D7B9BEAEE50E,"Dear ; Mr principal i have done some resarch, and i think that it's a good idea to change the school cafeteria menu, to a more healthier food. I know that it wil be a big change, but it will help the students alot here in school, i have some reasons of why you must change the school menu and how it will help us.

The first reason is because the parents of the students won't have to be worry anymore of what thier children are eating in school, you know that there are some parents that want thier children to eat healthier, and if we change the menu they wont be worry all the time, because they will know that thier children are eating healthy food, every single day they wont be eating junk food.

My second reason is that the student will be heathy, and strong, they will also be more active, and ready to learn at school they wont be sleeping that much, and they wont be so lazy, because what the student are eating right now in school that is junk food it will make them, less active and their brain won't function good though the whole day. Thats why you should consider to change the school menu do it for the children that goes to school so they can be healthy and learn new things every single day.

My last reason, is that the student won't be geting sick alot, and they will coming to school more often, they wont be missing alot of school day beause of the healthy food that they will be eating from our school every day, we will also be helping their parents because when their children get sick they spend alot of money for doctor and medicine, but since we will be giving healthy food to the children they wont be geting sick alot. and we will be teaching them the importance of eating healthy food and being healthier.

This are my reason of why you should change the school menu so please consider this idea because we will be alot more healthier then what we are right now and our brain will functon good, and it will help us for the rest of our life, because in school is were we spend must of our time and we learn everything here, its like our second home do this for our future and for the good of the school.

BD8683F93B5A,"Dear Generic_Name

I understand that you are considering the benefits of working with a group or working alone. This could be a big deal depending the class because the majority of students prefer to work alone, we should use some of the time that we have in class to vote and see what students want, but i agree with the idea of working with a group for two reasons: we can devide the work and you get to talk to other students while their working.

First reason is that it feels like we do get the enough time to work, when we get to work with groups everything gets a lil bit more easy because there is less work to do, and if they decide to work alone, you would notice that they are going to have more problems completing the assignment, while the other studens that are working in group they would find this assignment more easy, so the way the teacher don't have to spend to much time with only one student.

Second reason is that they should not have problems finding the information because while some of them are writing the other students should it be serching for anwsers, for example, students that are working alone they would find this a lil bit harder because they have to do the writing and searching part by them self. The best part of working with a group is that the work can be finished a lot faster and they can have more time to recheck the work and make sure that you are not missing anything in blank.

Also, there is a lot of benefits of working with a group or working alone, but its clear that those students are not going to work with other students because they say that they don't like to be talking to other students, that they prefer to work alone, but anyways the teacher should be agree with this, thats how she would know if you need more help with the assignment then other students.

I strongly believe that working with a group could be the best choice for students because they are not going to spend to much time doing the assignments, so you could work with someone and devide the work wich positively affects, therefore, we must try it and see what benefits can we get from this and voting could be a good idea to decide if students would like to work in group.

7C08DA95AE9A,"One way to improve student achievement is to start a after school homework club.

Teachers and students should start meeting after school this idea would benefit students by getting extra support, turning assignments on time get a better understanding of the things that the teacher teach on class, establishing the club would help those students who don't turn in assignments on time or those who like to do things early.

In order to students to be successful they need extra support a better explanation of the things they learn, many students struggle with the assignments and most of them don't ask for support through the school year I have seen many students raping the assignments because they don't understand them, but if the school make the the idea of starting a club there would be no excuse for students to not be successful in their homework, tests, and class assignments.

Students should start turning assignments on time specially those who don't turn in on time, the club would help many students like instead of going home and forgot that they have assignments to do they could come and join the after school homework club. I have friends who like to do homework and be successful, but the problem is that they don't understand the assignments and if someone don't understand something why should they do it because either way they going to get the assignment wrong the school must provide more support for students.

In addition the club could not be just of getting help or finish assignments early, the club could be a place were students can find support and motivation in order to be a better person on life many students don't care about school because they don't find the good thing about it maybe because they need a motivation to be at school the after school club could be a place where people can meet and share ideas or meet each other and make a friendship helping each other to understand better the thing that they don't understand.

In conclusion the school must make the after school club in order to get more successful students and to also help and motivate students to do their assignments and turning them on time. extra support is a better way to understand the things you don't understand, turning assignments make a student seem responsible and also get a good admiration of others making friends and share, discuss thing together is a better way to solve a problem that they had.",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,3.1555731,3.008117,3.2644808,3.1415215,2.9977005,3.1436858,3.1835701,3.108418,3.3478696,3.1539028,3.3195214,3.0061715,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,430,8,0.3325581395348837,53.75,1,3,"{'homework', 'motivate', 'raping'}"
36B2E183713B,"People and educators feel like we need to have year round schools, is that a good idea? I feel like we do need to have year round schools. Because when we go back to school most of the students don't remember anything from last year, we would get more days to understand things and remember it.

If we start to remember things we did we would not need to have to go over so many things and get to the new stuff for like Math, History, English. The more days were in school we understand the things more and it will stick to us more. Because the more that we start doing in class and we get help with it, we will know what to do when it comes for us to takes test or Sols.

Like sometimes when I come back to school I really don't remember what we learned last year or how to do certain problems for math or what ever class it is. But maybe with this year round school thing I might be able to remember these things depending what we learn in class. I think the reason we don't remember things so much is because we really don't pay attention or we're not really focused on what we're learning. So now with the more days we have maybe we could get a chance to try different teaching methods so the other students can get more attached to what we are learning about and focus more o things in class.

I'm liking the idea of this year round school, because there more opportunities we can have and more ways so we can focus because of the days were going to have. The only downfall of this is that are summer is going to be less than usually but I mean well get other days off so thats good. Hopefully with this new school thing it will be easier to remember all the information and things we learn.

I feel like that the year round school thing could work, it would help out tons of people with remembering things. So there classes could become easier because they would remember what they did last year and know how the problem or question is. It would honestly help me out a lot because I would be able to do more work because I would know how to do the work. I think this would work and be very successful so we can try and see what happens!

C41E40F2D803,"Do you know how many careers' choices you have when you enter to high school? Most of the new students in high start thinking about what career they would like to take after they finish high school. Although some say students should not commit to a career at a young age because make students feel pressure, actually students should commit to a career at a young age because help students to preparate for the future and they have more time to choose the career they like.

Although some say students should not commit to a career at a young age because make students feel pressure. In most cases students become stressed because of their parents telling them to start selecting a career at a young age. Students behavior change; However their grades get affect it bacause of the stress and pressure. Some people say that school should talk to students' parents, so students don't feel pressure selecting a career at a young age. When the parents know they have a lot time before collage.

First reason why students should commit a career at a young age because help students preparate for the future and let them know what is better for them. Students preparation is base on saving money to pay for collage. They can see what is better for them; In other words what career benefit them more and if they allowed to pay it. Students can know early where they can get help either from their parents, or if they has to work for the career that they want. Students can talk with their parents aboout a student loans too.

Second reason why students should commit a career at a young age because they have more time to look for a career that they like more. They have more time to look for a career with the charateristics they like. Students have more time to save money. They can know other careers where they can get a good pay. Teachers can help students to get a good career base in their Knowledge.

In conclusion students should commit a career at a young age bacause as I said helps the students to preparate. The time is one of the best reason that help them. The knowledge from other people help the students what is better. Students dont get pressure also they have more oppurtunities. Students should commit a career at a young age because is one of the best choice they can do.

Ever since I was a little girl I have dreamed about going to Europe and exploring it. All the articles and social media posts I have seen or read about this place make it seem as though it is the greatest place on Earth. If I ever get the opportunity to visit any place on Earth I would I would decently choose Europe. I would love to experience their culture and try new things while there. I would also go sight seeing and exploring every second I could.

The first thing I would do in Europe is try out European food. I would go to a small town or city and ask the locals where their favorite place to eat is and what it is that they like to order there. After eating I would go around the town I was in and talk to the locals about what it's like to live in a place like Europe. Another thing I would like to do while there is try out their fashion. I would go to different designers and ask them about the difference in the fashion from Europe to the one in the United States is. Lastly, since it is a special trip I would treat myself to a shopping spree.

The most important thing I would be doing while there, is going sight seeing to famous places. Firstly, I would go visit the notorious Mona Lisa I have been dying to see in real life. Secondly, I would go on a walk to visit the Eiffel Tower. While there I will take cute pictures to post on social media for memories. Lastly, I would visit a bunch of art museums and look at paintings sculptures for hours on end.

In conclusion, If could visit any place in the world I would visit Europe. Everything about this place is astonishing and I would one day like to enjoy that myself. Coming from a small city named Covington, it would be a huge change in scenery for me. I would love to experience their culture and try new things there while visiting.

8AD96DB8DD9F,"Do you agree or disagree with ""imagination is more important than knowledge""? I agree with this statement because it helps you when your reading books, studying, and learning. I learn more when I imagine things at school or other places.

To begin with, I like reading books because it helps me when I'm mad or just in general. Comedy books are one of my favorite to read because it cheers me up more than anything beside music. I like imagining things when I read because it makes the story more interesting like people talking in my head. Imagining helps me learn more because I am a slow learner I don't learn fast like other kids do so I like to sit down and imagine all the things the teacher was talking about so I can catch up with the class.

Also, Imagination helps me a lot when it comes to studying because I am not good at remembering things. Studying is not my thing yet because there are big words I don't understand especially when it comes to English and math. English is more of smart people stuff I get so lost in English because we do a lot of work at once and the confuses me. English taught me new things I never knew before like having a introduction in every paragraph.

In addition, Learning is hard when you have a lot of kids in the class playing and not letting the other kids learn. Some people take learning as a joke but I take it seriously because I want my dreams to come true I always wake up in the morning happy to go to school to learn something new. Learning is important it helps people get to where they want to be either it's a dream, a location or read and write things. It is all imagination it helps a lot of people each and everyday by studying, learning or reading books because I enjoy it a lot it helps me fill up my emptiness.

In conclusion, I agree imagination is more important than knowledge because it a it of people just like it helps me. Learning is important because it helps you reach your goals in life, and studying is not my thing but imagination helps me with studying because I can imagine the things we talked about.

777F0E16E55E,"Some people don't know how to play basket ball, Well I have some things that might help you with basket ball or build it or anything with the sport. The frist thing is the enviroment, most people play outside and others play inside, well I think you should play outside mostly on summer days because the enviroment is more cooler or warmer than other months. The second thing you should do is to try not to play in extreme temperature. The thrid thing is make sure its not high winds outside to be cold, this will effect your gameplay for basket ball if its high winds. Fourth thing is the good days to play basket ball, like summer days or sping time. The last thing for the enviroment is the day time and nigth time, you should play in the day time because nigth time you can't see much but in day time you can pretty much see everthing.

Equipment is important for basket ball, so here some things you would need for basket ball. The frist thing is a basket ball, make sure the ball is full of air and a frim grip. When play basket ball make sure the court is large enough for the sport. The court need to be a flat surface for the basket ball not to roll off. The next thing is a pole for the basket, make sure the pole is high enough for the basket and the ball to reach. The basket needs to be wide enough for the ball and a net that is short enough for the ball. The last thing for equipment is the out line of the court, it needs the out line for lineing up shots.

The skill of basket ball is important because of the gameplay is to win the game. Fitness is important for basket ball because it can bring up your stamina. Team work can make the game change from a losing game to a wining game, just by passing the ball to a teammate is important for skill. If you want to be good at the game then practice and trained your shots and make new openings. Strategy is important with teammates to win the game, think of new ways to beat the oppitsite team.

C49F716838E7,"Should students attend to year-round schools?

Considering year-road schools they are good for students to attend too because they retain more information,students stay in school,and become more responsible students.

In my point of view, I think they are too expensive,students do not spent time with family or friends,and dont have the opportunity to have new experiences in life; for example having a summer job.

For example the experience I had in life with year-round schools was in Generic_City, when I lived their with my family for over ten years after living in the United States for nine years for my life; and for my parents for over twenty year of living in the United States; moving to Generic_City was a big change of life to my family. My parents wonted the best for me and my brothers, so we attended to a year -round school. It was not easy being their because me and my brothers did not know much Spanish but know is are first language. Also it was too expensive,and students did not spend time with family, all kids do is attend to school all year.

After me and my brothers finish up are year in that school, my parents decided to move us to a normal school to spend more time in home, and have more life experience. It was so much better being in a normal school because I had more time in school vacation as a student, also had a summer job, and more time for me and family.

Also I experence more new thing in my normal school like being part of a band, playing for the school soccer team,being part of the drill team enjoying school like kids shoud do.

In my point of view student should not attend to year-round school because some students have part time job,it too expensive attend at year-round schools , and some students plan family vacation out of the country to spend time together.

But having this year-round school some students retain more information and stay focus to learn more information. Also by not attending to year-round schools some students have more life experience and become responsible in life.

In conclusion i consider students should attend to normal schools because they are less expensive,students can have a part time job, and also have some more life experience to help them become more responsible persons.

Sometimes you need to seek guidance from experts opinions about life's important matter, because not everything you think its right its going to be right.

Its also not a bad thing if you chose your own idea or if you seek guidance for the information, if you do both either one is right in my opinion. I think that if you really want to know about life's important value you need to either ask a guidance from expert that know all of the information about life's important matters or if you know the right information you will be fine but its also a great idea to check with experts to make sure that the information you know it's correct or to learn more about it.

Students might change their minds of playing around in school from visiting this type of job students will see people working hard and fast every single day and getting paid a small amount so students would not want to be working at a place like that in there future so it could pursue them to start putting more effort in school and not to play around in class, and have a successful job.

Some parents don't have money to put their child in school Furthermore there are going to have to work at a hard working job but students don't have to because you have a chance and you got your education so it might teach students to take this advantage to have a success job and not to play around on the other hand teens that don't get their education will work at a place that pay a small amount.

If students don't take their education serious your parents paid the money for your education and if you just don't pay attention and not try the money your parents paid will be a waste because you didn't learn anything cause you goof of and you won't be able to have a successful job so visiting this job will change students thought pf whether they should play around or not so if you take your education serious you can have a job that pays you a lot of money and be successful in life but not doing anything in school won't get you anywhere.

4F89EB8CB97F,"I think this is a great idea, normally a person graduated in four years, but if we graduate en three years of school it will be the best for our future, because we can take advantage, start college one year early, and finish it one year early, and it will better for any student who wants to take advantage in life. I think it will be better but this is going to be hardest because you have to study more time, and have classes in summer, and evenings but all effort has its rewards.

If two girls are in High School one of these (person A) took the programs that allow students to graduate in three years, and the other one (person B) took the traditional four years.

The person A graduated from high school in 2015 and the person B in 2016. while the person A was studying her first year in college and working, the person B is in her last year of school, obviously 2019 is the last year for person A in college and graduate from college will help her to work in something about her career.

Well what I do is if I graduated in just three years I will take advantage for work hard and take some few classes before go to college all the fourth year, and then the next year I will have a good amount of money for college, and when I going to college I keep working but less hours, I think this of allow high school students to graduated in three years is great idea. Knowing that the students only have three years in high school it will help the students to put effort in high school and to finish early high school and college.

A2C232F3D92C,"Are you happy with your self? Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" Do you agree or disagree with this statement? I agree with this statement, being yourself and not letting people change you is a great accomplishment. One should never allow someone to change you.

To be yourself is the best way to the greatest accomplishment because people try to persuade you or talk to you about doing something else that doesn't impressed you. You have to actually think about what you actually want to do to accomplish in life. You don't have to listen to what other people say and tell you. Most of the time people gives wrong advice to others. You have to believe in yourself, that you can accomplish greater thing just doing what you admire.

Go with what you think its a good decision for you, either being by yourself or need someone to tell you what to do. Most of time people doubt others. Having a strong feeling that being by yourself is a good decision for you, that a good thing because thats means you have no problems of being by yourself. If you know that you going to succeed in life then that amazing because you believe in yourself . Go with that decision that you think is right and don't allow nobody to make you do something that you don't think is wrong.

However, there are people who think allowing someone to change you can be an accomplishment. Only if it is for the good. For example, if someone is having a hard time being a good citizen and they are always getting into trouble, then yes changing them is a good thing. You can help them out by saying "" what you doing is not a great decision, you should have better choices then getting into trouble."" Another example, is if someone is having a difficult time, you could help them by giving them good advice how to accomplish something.

Being yourself lead to great accomplishment. I agree with this statement. Sometime people try to change you because they thought you couldn't succeed with what you wanted to become or wanted to accomplish. Sometimes being yourself doesn't goes as plan as you thought it going to go. In my decision being yourself and actually knowing what to do is the best decision to the greatest accomplishment.

02B36EBD5C66,"Students can benefit from this option, but also can affect them in different ways. Many students have difficulty coming to school every single day. One impediment may be transportation, a lot of them do not know how to drive, so they can not drive to school. Some students live in areas where the buses can't enter. Many of them walk to get to school every day or ride a bicycle. They face many problems but the biggest one is weather. The climate can change quickly, when is raining a lot or is cold these students stay at home, because there is no way how they can get to school.

Students can benefit by not attending everyday to school. For students who live far away from school is a great option, because they safe time and also they can work during the day. As we see many students have a job after school, and this is hard for them because they have to be active in school. There is a big problem because they come tired to school, and you see them sleeping in classes. They can not be concentrate because they do not have time to sleep. Many of them do not have time to do homework, or different projects they have to complete.

It is a great option to have schools that offers distance learning. This action help many students but also can affect them. In my opinion when you attended to school everyday you can learn more. Because you have all the resources you need to understand, and complete the assignments. But students who like to work hard and take their time to studying in their houses, it can also be easy for them.

Before that there was not technology is was extremely hard. Now that the science had grown up, and the technology appear, we have a way more opportunity to do many things. One opportunity is to studying online from our houses. As I said now that we have technology, we have more opportunities and is really easy to find stuff that you need to learn in your school.

In my conclusion, I think is good for our society having those school who offers distance learning. Because many students can not be in school everyday, and this action help them to keep studying. If this program does not exist many of them could never go again to school, because of all the impediments they have to attend school, and they will never accomplish their dreams.

If you don't have good attitude in what we're doing then we can never get the things that we have to do done for for instance if I didn't have a good attitude everytime things got hard I wouldn't have done the things I did. Take for example If I would've had a bad attitude everytime something went wrong in my life I wouldn't be as happy as I am now because we all go through difficult times but how we choose to handlle it is way different.

Take famous people for example if they would've given up everytime people said horrible things to them they wouldn't Have as much money as the do now or famous as they are now. People who don't have good attitudes don't want other people to have success because they wish they had a good enough attitude to do what others are doing. If we decide to have a good attitude we can get more things done and accomplish way more then anyone else.

It's also nice to help other people with they're attitudes. By helping other people we can have way more success it's just simple if we want to accomplish more then we can help people with they're attitudes and help them get way more things done. Another example I have a friend and she didn't have a good attitude about her grades but she didn't want to work hard to improe them so I told her if she wanted to get her gades up she had to have a good attitude about them and she did the she started working harder and she improved so much.

Having a good attitude in life can help us out so much when we want to sucessced. It is important to have a positive outlook on life and not focus on the negative things. If we focus on the negative things to much we may forget to look at all the positive things in life. It's better to spend our time enjoying life instead of worrying about our problems alot. After all we only live once and if we spend our whole life being negative then we won't be happy in life.

A meal contains:the main course, a side of vegetable or fruit,and a drink of our choice. Given a healthier meal we will be productive in school,and our everyday life. Eating a healthier meal will reduce the chances of being obitisty. A lack of a bad food would result the chances of not getting enough knowledge,compare to having a healthy meal. The school cafeteria should serve a healthy meal.

Students look forward eating lunch during school,because lunch refuels the mind,and the body with important victims. Lunch is the second important meal of the day,because students look toward a short break during school to refill their body,and mind. Eating a healthy meal in the middle of day will help students pay attention during school. Junk food is bad to serve during lunch, because it won't allow the students to be more active during the day,and pay attention in class. Overall students need a healthy meal to go on with there life during school,and outside school.

Throughout the years the chances of being obesity has increased. One of the main reasons why is because school lunches has served unhealty food. Junk food is unhealthy for the human body,because getting enough food will make you gain weight. Calories are based on what you eat,eating unhealthy will make you gain weight while eating healthy will help you balance out calories. Eating healthy will help reduce the chances of being obesity.

Eating a health meal during school will make the students be productive during school. Biting into an apple is the same thing, as drinking a sip of coffee. If we don't serve healthy food the chances of being active in school will decreases. If we serve our students unhealthy food than they will be lazy throughout the day. Giving the students a healthy meal will make them be more productive.

Therefor serving your students a health meal for lunch will help them accomplish obstacles in school. Serving your students will help them improve of being smart. Knowing that if you serve your students healthy options on what to eat they will not be obese. Productive is based on what we eat.

Although some say that people shouldn't to be guide by experts because they don't like to people tell them what to do, actually people should be guide by experts because they can show people to love each other and make a better world with no violence.

Their are people that don't like to be guide by others but they have a knowing in their life in what is good and bad by their experiences. For example my gram pa, he doesn't like to be guide by others but he said that he has an understanding in what is good and bad. He also told me that some people try to guide you for the bad way, by showing you how to drink beers or smoke cigarettes and you have to be ready to say not to those type of drugs but, I believe that we need to have experts and authorities to guide us about life's important.

Actually, people should seek guidance from experts and authorities because some experiences have better knowing then other ones and learn how to love each other. I would like to be guide by experts and learn about their experiences. That could be awesome.

Some times is better to make your own idea because that person that is by your side such as, your girlfriend or your mother could be wrong, and there is when you make a mistake and start to be disappointed with your self, In that time is when you are frustrated and you could kill your self or hurt someone else.

Violence can be make by a bad understanding. That's why people should seek guidance from experts and learn how to talk to each other. Usually if you are young , sometimes we don't know have to talk and their where problems came from. However

I encourage to al young people you seek guidance from experts until they have a better knowing in their decisions.

We as humans always make mistakes and we learn through them, but we need help from each other. We need to stopped the violence and start to love each other, but we have to seek guidance from expert and authorities about life important matter.

D129F19FF7F7,"People should make their own decisions to avoid bad guidance from other ""experts"".

Everyone should make their own decisions because they know themselves better, they know what they like and what they want, mentally and physically. For example if someone bought someone else something that they didn't like or didn't want and is the total opposite of what they needed, they wouldn't have sent the other person to go get it in the first place, now would they?

Also, people should make their own decisions so that they could learn from their own mistakes and their misjudgments. For example, people buy the wrong size of clothing online everyday without trying it on in stores first. People will now know to go in stores first or to get themselves measured first before ordering clothes online. Another example, is that people look at something they think is interesting and nice, but won't read the directions or the descriptions that come with it and once the package that they got or ordered it at their homes and in their possession is either not like the picture or is smaller then what they thought it would be or is just one piece of what you ordered. This is a great learning experience for them to not do it again and to always read the descriptions of what you're ordering comes with.

Lastly people should make their own decisions because not all ""experts"" can really help you with your situation or not even do so well on your case. For example, people can pay a lawyer a huge amount of money for them just to fail on your court case. Another example, people pay to see a doctor for something they think is wrong with them because they're hurting badly and doctors will say you're perfectly fine and prescribe you an expensive pain killer, which people can already have at their homes. Last example, a therapist can also prescribe you medication that you don't need but will still give it to you because they can. Some therapist don't believe in that but most do.

So therefore, these so called ""experts"" sometimes don't know what they're doing or sometimes they are trying to make money out of innocent people or even sometimes is it always okay to make some mistakes and learn from them and your misjudgments.

I believe that our characteristic traits have a lot to do with the people that we choose to surround ourselves with. We have all been influenced in a certain way by someone. Whether if that was being convinced into doing something that we didn't want to do or if it we were given a confidence boost to tackle the challenge ahead of us.

There have been many cases where someone gets into a lot of trouble by doing something that they didnt want to do. They were brainwashed into doing what everyone around them told them to do because they were the people who they truly trusted. But in the end they where just let down by them. For example there are many known cases where some innocent teenager gets a drug addiction because they were influenced to do them by the people who they were surrounding themselves with. This one poor decision has now changed that persons entire life by someone who they probably wont even remember their name in ten years. They wont get the opportunity to play in any sports teams because of their current state. People will look down on them because of what they have done in the past. They wont get the same job opportunities as other people because of their mental and physical state.

Because of this we should be able to love ourselves the way we are and we shouldnt need the influence of people around us to shape our lives, we should be forward and honest with people, if you dont want to do something they that are telling you to do you need to build up your confidence and tell them that you wont get involved in such a thing.

Does this mean that you will loose a couple friendships? Sure but at least you did what was right and you were able to take control over your life and make what you think are the right decisions. Now that person is probably going to get into a lot of trouble by what they have done but you wont because you were able to take matter into your own hands and do what was right for your future.

People should always seek guidance from experts and authorities whenever they are making any big decisions. It will be more easier for them to choose options when they seek guidance from someone who already knows about it. People often tend to make wrong decisions when they make decisions by themselves. A lot of celebrities have their personal guidance which is their manager. Manager makes a thoughtful decisions for celebrities to keep them on track of their career. If celebrities tend to make their own decisions many celebrities would go downfall in their career.

The decisions people make should be thoughtful and have guidance from experts. Christopher from into the wild book, he is one of the example for to take advise from experts or else people will end up like Chris. Christopher did not take any guidance from anyone while going into the wild of Alaska alone. He did not have any good materials to take with and didn't ask for help. MC candles died into the wild of Alaska because he was not prepared for the trip he was going into. This is exactly why people should take advise, if he would have taken any advice what so ever he would most likely have survived in the Alaska wilderness. He chose not to take any guidance which is the reason he died into the wilderness.

Because that decision de the person and the time, not important for take one career. Each young person has a decision to purse a career or not because it is optional.

First of all I disagree whit this idea, because young students are more like to listen what adults tell them to chose. That ends up on kinds chosen careers they dont want or like and in the long run it takes away their Dreams, money, and time. The kinds need more inspiration for that in future they take one career like: doctor, arquitec, teacher, and other carriers is good have one inspiration. Is good have persons that support in every time like Mom, family or dad. Because much young not listen the adult or not have support in the family for that reason they do not pursue a career.

Secondly us young adults need to expand our knowledge in the work field. Like for example we need to watch videos and have people already working their to explain How they work and ward they do.

First, if you solve math problems more often, you will be good at organizing things. Solving math can make you think about spending time. It will create a thought about how you spend time. Eventually, you will learn how to spend your precious time wisely. Additionally, it will lead you to good decisions. Basically solving problems is like, when you have to make a wise decision. You have to figure out the best solution that you can think of. After that, this process can help your personal problems. We use math everyday to solve our personal problems. Math is not just a subject, it is teaching you life skills too. Solving math problems can lead to good organizing skill.

Next, If you do math, it can help your grades go up and get it more better. First of all, if you start doing math, your grade for math will be satisfied. Math subject requires a your time for studying and it takes your patients too. Taking the time to study for math always pays off. In the end, your grade will be good and it will be all worth it. Then, when your grade is good, you will be more relaxed and pleased with your life. When you have a bad grade, it really does feel awful and the you will be ashamed by yourself. But when you have a good grades, it just makes you feel better and good. Eventually, If do math more than usual, start doing it for your free time, you will be good at other school subjects. Every subject has little bit of math. For example, science is basically a different form of math. For me, figuring out math problems helps your grades get better.

Solving math equations is my talent, when you do math, I think you get more organized and your grades go up.

However, some say school shouldn't offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home because students wouldn't get enough knowledge at home, it's better in school.

Actually, students should be able to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. First, Online is useful in many ways. Students can research the information, or students can watch video on YouTube. For example, Math, some students don't understand how to solve the equations, but they can watch the video and find more math learning. Also, English essays. last year, my English teacher told me to write an essay about the night by Eli Wisely. I researched him because I didn't know who he was at first, and I found his history in the holocaust, I read it. It was very tragedy. So, I wrote it down for project, and I found a lot information in the holocaust. It was useful finding information on Google.

Second, video conferencing is helpful. There is a website called Edubirdie. This website is use for teachers communicating with students for education. Students can spend time with teacher like 24 hours or depends on what time students chooses. Edubirdie helps students with essays, math problems, social studies, science, etc.. Also, I remembered when I had a final exam for chemistry, and the problem was I didn't learned anything from chemistry class. Because my teacher was horrible, I didn't learned anything from him. So, I searched to Edubirdie website and watched some videos of stochiometry problem and word problems. Then, I face timed a Chemistry teacher from Edubirdie. I spend like 10 hours with her. It helped me little bit. After that, I took the final exam and I barely passed the class with the D+. at least I passed the class and I'm happy with it.

738112C600B8,"Do you think first impressions are impossible to change ? In my opinion a first impression on someone or something change be changed, because you never know what the stereotype of the thing can be.

When you first meet someone your first impression on the person can be one thing but you never know what the person could have. For example you see a fat guy or female and you can be quick to judge them but you don't know anything about there life, till when you talk to them and get to know their true story that they medical conditions on why they are the way the appear and look like. You could meet a Hispanic, For example you might thing they came to US illegally, but you don't really know that some Hispanic are actually born in the united states and are legal citizens. when you see a Asian person you may think there smart because of your first impression stereotype, but not all Asian are actually smart and appear to who you really think they are.

Next is the type of thing you purchase or are going to purchase, it can look nice and be expensive but you dont know the background story on the item or thing you are going to purchase. For example when you want to purchase a car or house, you can be looking at it on the internet and like it a lot but once you buy it you start noticing strange thing. If it is the car you realize the its starting to give you a lot of problems that you are constantly taking money out you'r pocket to try to fix it to your expectations and what were your first impression on the car being nice and reliable. Second a house you're impression where ""oh wow this is a really nice house"", so you go on and purchase it the you start realizing that the house was making wired noises at night while you are trying to sleep, Then one day you go online and contact the landowner or research the history of the house and realize the house is haunted because the original owner past away their.

A first impression is just a stereotype or judgment that you think of someone or something before not know the background story on it. Before you go and be quick to judge some based on their looks talk to the person see why they are really the way they look before making fun of them of talk about them because everyone in this world isnt perfect and everything has a story behind it.

1DDC2D1DB4EE,"Dear principal, I'm writting this letter to let you know my opinion on the idea of change the school lunch menu into a new healthier menu. I think that it would be a good idea change the lunch menu to be more healthy because it will help the students to consume less unhealthy food, can help students to stay healthy and could encourage the students to begin eat healthier.

Students consume unhealthy food on school alsmost every day, change the menu into a healthier will help students to consume less unhealthy food. Eating unhealthy food daily could damage students in many differents ways. One this ways is that could bring students diseases such as heart problems or could cause obesity in a young age. Additionally change the menu could not just be benefical for students it could also help teachers and personal staff as well to consume less unhealthy food daily.

By having a healthier menu could help the students to stay healthier because they will be eating the proteins that they needed to develped better. Also this could help students to do better in things such as sports, and their respectives classes on school. Another advantage of this menu is that will give students the opportunity to try something new instead of having the same food that they're had been having year over year. In addition by doing this could migth make students realize that having this menu is not just to force them to eat food that they don't like, instead is to keep and them stay healthy.

Even thougth that some of the students will migth think that this would be a bad idea because will eliminate some of their favorite food, I think it will be helpful for them because by doing this will encourage them to begin to eat healthier, because that could help them now and on the future. Also this could encourage them to covince their friends and family to begin to eat healty because this could prevent them from having a disease just for eating unhealthy food.

In conclusion I think that change the school menu into a new healthier lunch menu is a good idea, because it will help the students to consume less unhealthy food, could help them to stay healthy and could encourage them begin to eat healthier. Those are the reasons that make me think this way, I hope this letter could help you decide that implement this plan is a good idea to change the school for better.

7DDFF6DA8655,"What would make feel much better in class to work alone or in groups? Would it make you feel better and more productive? Some people think that working in groups helps them be more productive and helps them get the job done easier. There could be teachers who wouldnt support the idea of working in groups. If you're trying to convince your teacher you have to have examples to support your position.

Working in a group is more productive and easier it gets the job done quicker then you expect. You can assign each classmate your working with a job duty. One of each classmate can work in drawing, writing, searching up facts about the assignment and not least but last the leader to put everything together and help his classmates when needed. There can be minor things when working in groups. You could expect some who would do there job and just take advantage of time and not be productive. The leader is expected to get there classmates to work and not waste time.

When working alone instead of in groups there can be advantages. Like Having more time in the assignment and not rushing into it. You can have your own ideas without others forcing you to change it up into something they all like. When it comes to mistakes you can point them out yourself and correct them. Instead of stressing about who is not working and who can't get the job done you can work on your own. There could be problems too like not having enough time and can't get your job done as quick as you need it to be. There is other classes to worry about.

Some teachers wouldn't support the idea of working i groups. Instead they would like for you to work alone to get your job done easier. But not every student would support that idea of working alone. Some students could be left back and behind from class so they would need the help from his classmates. There is supporting ideas on why it would be so much better in groups and it would be to get the job done easier and faster. Being alone isn't very helpful when you need the help you do.

Working in groups would not just help students but teachers on grading your work. It can be stressful for them when it comes to working alone and having so much papers to grade. The idea of working with other students would be much more easier and productive. It would feel way better for you and other classmates.

BA5DC45B0E3F,"Our character develop sometimes by our own choices, and other times it develops by the influences in life, we can choose what kind of a person we want to be either good or bad, some choose to be both you can't really pick a side and stay at it , there's good in every bad and there's bad in every good. Some choose to be bad because they think if they choose to be a good person people will take advantage of them since good people always the ones who cares so much , help others all the time , and think about people happiness before theirs. They're wrong in my opinion because being a good person is better than being bad who are most likely the selfish ones that don't care about anyone except themselves. But in my opinion having a character isn't just about being a good or a bad person , it's about having a good personality , loving yourself and loving people , making others happy , having a positive energy , but also most importantly not forgetting about yourself. No one can really have a perfect character everyone got a dark side in them but only show it when needed , like if they were hurting or something bad happened to them or any other life reasons, that's if you choose your own character and choose to be good or bad. Sometimes you really can't choose your own character because the influences of life will choose it for you nothing will be in your control , it all depends on the life you were born in , like your culture , religion , and the people around you , but that's not all sometimes the way life goes is the reason your character change you can choose to be something and life's decisions will choose something else for you , life can be like a puzzle it never lets anyone stay as they are , they always change , grow up , be mature , or things that happens with them in life will make them grow up even if they're young or still not an adult yet. For me I think age isn't the thing but a number , the thing that make you mature is your character and the way you think , if life didn't force you to have a specific character then choose your own character and make it different don't try to copy someone else and be life them , just be you , be different it's more beautiful.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0866652,2.98388,3.2394676,3.138403,3.0306106,3.0266728,3.5466316,2.7117243,3.4273922,3.3478258,2.967925,3.0187473,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,422,7,0.4075829383886256,60.285714285714285,4,1,{'hurting'}
14AC534FFE42,"graduating early is a very good idea but before start with my opioun or make any suggestions i would like to take sides first. graduating early comes with a lot of work and troubles . before you will be able to graduate early, you will need two math , two science ,two history and other elective subjects to graduate .but if you don't have any of that or maybe failed some classes in your freshmen year or sophomore year, it's all pales up and wait for you in your senior year. or maybe you refused to go to summer school or even take some classes during the summer, it's affect you in your senior year. summer school sometimes help you to reduce some classes during your school year.

Every high schooler's"" dream is to walk on stage with a big smile on his/her face. but if you don't do the necessary part of passing your Sol and getting good

GPA to college , you might as well want to stay and wait for your traditional four years.

Many high school er""s sometimes want to leave high school and go to college because they want to live on their own, out from home,experience new things, meet new friends, or even meet new people and learn about other things and also sometimes too student graduate early or want to graduate early because they don't. like their school or get bullied a lot in high school due to that they try their possible best to leave the school before something happen to him/her.

But from my point of view I think every high school er should wait till their traditional four years of high school because college can be very very stressful if you not well organized or you not well fit.

And also before you make a decision to go to college or even work force or maybe start a life right after high school, make sure you are financially stable because college or anywhere else after high school will be very tough and very challenging.

Preparing to graduate early and go to college a year early it's very hard sometimes because you wouldn't know what you want do in college and you will be on a waiting list and you will have to pay for every semester which is going to be a waste of money and also time . so i think every high schooler's should wait till their traditional four years and be more prepared and financially stable before they graduate .

2157AE4AFAA6,"I agree that people make their own decisions to learn about life, and be more independent. Sometimes it is difficult to follow advices, but that can make us a better person every day. As an illustration, every people comit defeats, yet that can teach us to be more stronger people,and never give up. People will grow only if they start being independents, trying new things, and learn to be better by they own self.

By being more independently, people will learn how to take their own decisions. People can start taking their own decisions when they do not live with their parents anymore. As an illustration, they can find a good work, pay their own things, and having the capacity to make their owns decisions. Besides, people have to have more responsability; in order to take a decision because that can affect ourselves. However, that can makes us more stronger, and be more prepared in life.

Trying new experiences can also, teach us to be more independently, and learn about others people experiences in taking a decision. In fact, we can ask for advices to our parents or in someone that we trust because they will tell us what is good or what is bad for us. Additionally, sometimes there is people that the only thing that they do is judge us for the decision that we take, but that does mean that we are a bad person. We can propose to ourselves everything, and we should never get down.

Learn to be better by our own self ca help us in many ways. that can be a benefit into our life because in the ways we can be more responsables with ourselves. For example, we can take many decisions , but sometime we do not know if they are going to be good in the way how we planed them. Besides, we always can try to be a better person, and think more about every decision that we choose.

Take good decision in our life we make us to have a better future. First, people can take any decision that they want, but it is better to take them with responsability. trying new thing can take us of our comfort zone, and that is good because we can think more about the good decisions.

Well school is a place your suppose to feel comfortable in, there are many different schools. I personally think being home schooled can have it's advantages and disadvantage, you of course have benefits for example not being bothered by other classmates, and finishing your work on time without having a distraction, kids in outiside schools have that disadvantage of having classmates who don't care about there education and some kids get carried away and distracted and they end up having to repeat classes or stay another extra year, It's very different because years on years you can just retake the class at home with nobody judging you about failing, here it is like an embarassment to be seen another year so that's something to look into.

Home schooled kids i would say get more attention as in that one on one attention, I would also say outside schools get the same but there are plenty of full classes and the teacher can't always get around to all students. There are lots of kids who want to be able to attend outside school but they can't for many reasons for example a disability or how they are a celebrity, being in that situation you would want to not be known like that so your just forced and obligated to attend home school and that's when home school kids would think it would be better to be attending outside school you'll always be home and feel trapped you'll get tired of being in your own home, It does people good being able to socialize a bit.

School can also be finished faster during home school, lots of things are offered, but also lots of things are not offered for example lunch, in almost all public schools there is free lunch, free everything your getting a free education, home school is expensive and you will always provide your own food. The wifi at home will also be payed, the computer and just many things but as we know it can be beneficial in life your getting an education so it's worth the spend you'll get something out of it.

What's better than being home and getting an eduacation it's benefitting you and it will in the future, when you get a dipoma.

It's really exciting because all that hard work was worth it, and you made it, but to get through you had to give up many of the activities you liked as well as your time. That is why it's not a good idea for students to finish high school in three years, and enter college or the workforce one year early. Students must take classes during the summer. Many students may not be able to take elective classes. Finishing early can be very stressful for students.

Students finishing high school in three years must take classes during the summer or in the evenings. Many students work over the summer, and having to take classes would not give them time to get a job. Instead, students would have to attend to school, do homework, study for tests, and quizzes. Similarly, if students take classes in the evenings, and want to be enrolled in sports, or clubs, which require students to stay after school. They would not be able to participate.

If students finish high school early, they may not be able to take elective classes. In order for students to graduate, they have to take required classes. This required classes are also important when getting into a college. Having to take all the classes they need, can barely fit into their schedules. This would enable students to be enrolled in elective classes like art, drama, music, or photography.

Some people may say that students finishing high school in three years, and enter college or the workforce one year early, it's a good idea. However, it can be very stressful for students.

Has the limitation of human concact due to the use of technology had positive or negative effects on people's lives?

Towards to technology, lack of communication is going to ruin our human sociaty.

Especially when phones are advancing in the next years.

One day, technology will take over the human population.

Say this, one day a boy meets this girl from school and they were talking through a social media,

but one day, they thought to meet up in person and when they saw each other, it was really awkward at first, but then they became very good friends. So they started to go to the movies, the mall, restuarants, and etc.

They started as two random strangers to having a, boyfriend and girlfriend relationship. Saying this to someone is really touching, because liking someone is to die for, but there's rules to follow and things to do and not just kissing or making love, its being there for them and hopefully you'll be there too.

Meeting that special person is a blessing, because for so long people have been trying to talk to this special someone,

but its really hard to confess it through person, but throught a screen is pretty easy, but do you really mean it?

Saying ""I love you"" means alot to someone, but actually saying it over and over again, it just warms my heart to say this, but i think im in love. Not just saying to make people to break through a screen, because saying ""i wanna break up"" it really just says you do not have the heart to say it to their face. Honestly everyone who does this, should just atleast try it and see what's more than life, then just being on the phone most of the day.

Once the day comes everyone will just destroy their own phone to prevent from robot abomination.

Schools provide a variety of educational activity such as, Art. Art can be enjoyable because, there is always something to do, endless creativity, and it can also help you socialize. In Art you can build and create anything your mind thinks also it helps you express your creativity so you can figure out how to find yourself. Express your feelings by making drawings, paintings, and even sculpting will help you express your feelings in Art.

If you have trouble making friends at school don't worry, in Art you can meet people that share the same likes as you. Art helps you socialize, you can ask people for help on a specific topic and they can teach you what you never knew about. In Art you can meets people with different likes, even though they have a different way that they think of Art, Everything is still related.

In Art you can make drawings, paintings, sculpting and many more, Art is created every time you use your creativity and mind. You can express your creativity by creating Art, you can let all your emotions fill in just one drawing, painting, or others. In Art, creativity is most important and it is needed to create masterpieces, You can also express your skills of a specific topic or you can learn more and many other ways of Art.

When you think about Art you probably think of drawing or painting, right? Thats not all to Art, there is an endless amount of ideas you can do in Art. The ideas range from how creative you are, in Art you can make anything, some examples are: sculpting, ceramics, and paper mach'e models, Etc... You can learn how to make other kinds of art that you have never heard of. You can always learn new things in Art.

In conclusion, Art is an enjoyable activity because, it lets you express your inner self, the creativity that is hiding this whole time. Art includes letting your creativity flow, never ending ideas to do, and helps you socialize. I recommend this to students of any school, to see if they have an interest in Art or if they find it enjoyable. Reflecting this on myself, I personally enjoy Art a lot, I have made multiple friends this way and tried out the different types of Art, This is why I recommend this to any student to see if they have the same experience or same interest as I do.",2.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.6008134,3.5204427,3.682945,3.6291337,3.587545,3.5975318,3.3548846,3.2339585,3.4152358,3.464781,3.113893,2.8388457,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,416,18,0.4182692307692308,23.11111111111111,4,5,"{'sculpting', 'ceramics', 'enjoyable', 'socialize', 'masterpieces'}"
EAE70CCAFC13,"As a teens, do you think the failure can affect your life in the future? The issue of the failure consists to going from the failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. It is a good idea to have a failure.

The failure can make you better in the future. Alhough,the failure can improve a better ways in life. Becuase,when someone do something that they think are bad they can to make better next time, they want to have a better opportunities in their life's,maybe in their future can have better job .In conclusion, the failure can make a diferrent person to continue with their life and also their dreams. .

The failure can help to be a geat person. Although, the failure can make a different in your life. For example, if you have a failure you don't to do again, a failure can help to be a better person in the future. In conclusion, the failure can help in better ways if they think in opposite becuse sometime we do thing incorrect that if i have a role of failure can give a lesson to do thing in the better.

while some people believe that it is a good idea to have a failure. Other argue that,it is a bad idea to have a failure. Beacuse, all person have worries about failure, if they have a failure they want to be in thir house sad. Although this migh be valid, there are several importan idea to be considered, such as,they can learn about the failure. Although, they don't want to make the same error the same time. For example, if you have a failure you don't want to happend again you want to make better,also they don't want the same problems can afecct in the future. In conclusion,the want to learn about what the happened,they don't the same problems cuase toubles in their future.

B04F96DEDE6B,"Once someone told me,"" Focus on your goals, and keep focusing until you reach them, it does not matter if it takes long, at the end of the day it will worth it "". I think it is a good idea if you identify the carrer that you want to take and start getting into it at a young age, because you will have more time to know and study about it and how it works, and it is gonna be more easy. It could be difficult if at the end of the day you are about to gratuate and you do not even know what career do you wanna take.

One of the reasons why you have to decide what career you wanna take by the time you enter high school is that, you will focus in all your classes, but more in those classes that are related with your career, and you progress in school is gonna increase, and also your grades. You will be busy in a productive way doing things that will benefit you in school, because if you really wanna reach your goals you will not have chance to waste your time,

which is a good thing, instead doing nothing, bad thing, or only in video games. As how we are today, many teens are leaving school because maybe they think they found a better thing to do or because they took a bad decition.

But for those who really wanna be someone in the future and go for it, will have more opportunities, like Univercities credits and in their future job by dedicating their interest in school and doing their best.

Another reason is that your knowledge is gonna increrase, which is also a good thing, because you will learn a little bit about everything. In any career, you have to know about everything, even if it is a little bit, but you will learn new interesting things every days, things that you did not know before, and your interest in those things will drive you to search more about it and make you feel that you wanna know more and more about anything you are learning. All those are benefits that you can get by dedicating your interest in school.

In conclution, I think all students should have an idea of what career they wanna take, by the time they enter high school , so their courses of study in high school can help them when they are ready to go to the University, to not be difficult learn about it.",3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.4556084,3.332821,3.5190177,3.4810364,3.3453097,3.3693762,2.704559,2.7752786,3.2092357,2.288206,2.4838684,2.909906,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,435,11,0.3908045977011494,39.54545454545455,8,3,"{'wan', 'dedicating', 'video'}"
A38187259EEE,"For my own opinion , I think most students that have problems at school should take online or video classes at home to make it easier for them to learn and study.

Most students that are special , speaks different language or problems could and should take online classes. Even if you don't have problems you could take online classes if you wanted too. You dont have to go to school and learn , you stay home and learn in the computer. Homeschooling and online classes could be different but the sames at the same time. Learning at home could be better for you. Because at school cause you dont have no one to bother you , or giving you bad ideas , or cause trouble at schools on you learning experiences.

Some students would have benefits from being able attend classes from home? Some benefits could be like. "" What if its a bad idea to do it ? "" , "" What if I don't do good at it ? "" or "" What if I can't do it at home or at school ? "". Some have different ideas that it could be better for them to learn. At school it mighty be different cause there a lot of teacher and students that be different than you. At online school your at home with your parents and siblings? ad have only one teacher that teaches you on the computer. Its your dession to choose school to learn or online whatever that you comfortable for you to learn.

For me if I could choose , I'll choose going to school. Why? because its more better for me to learn from a teacher in person and see what they are do for me to learn. Online its okay , but staying at home make me get lazy and too comfortable by staying home. So for me to learn , is by going to public or private school are better for me to learn , educate , and socialize to others , its better for me.

So online classes are not for everyone. Like me I perfer going to school , not taking classes online. But what I say

"" whatever that make you comfortable for you to learn "". For me is going to school learn amd talk to other students. Wahtever you chosses for you to do then do it.

2010889A6522,"Hello dear reader. In the follows paragraphs I would like to tell you what I think about this issue because i believe that everyone got opinions or some ideas about this new ""proposal"" as well. First, I would like to discuss if this ""proposal' makes sence to me or not and wich are the advantages and disadvantages.

First thing I may say is the advatage and the disadvantage that we probably can see or find in the proposal. One adventage that comes along with this proposal is one schools day less. If the school follows the whole proposal; we can say or expect that friday or anyday will be off; wich means no school for us. In addition, we will have three days free. So, we can spent more time donig what we most love or enjoy. In the other hand, we have the disadvantages. I personally found one hugh disadvantage, the time. I personally think that the time that we will spent in the school is alot. Just think about it , how do you going to fell staying about 10 hours in the same place , spacially when that plece is not home. You might be get uncomfortable, or little irritable.

Secondly, I totally agree with the proposal because we gonna get more help on schools subject wich is good for us. Also we will avaible to do more school activities such as sports, fell trips, math stuff or any other amazing things. Besides, we will learnd more things such as lenguague stuff. like I said in my las sentence more time in the school could works for many of us.

Lastly, One more day free. We gonna spent more time in school, but at the same time we also can get one more day free. Folllowing the proposal we also can get other day free like Saturday or Sunday wich is good for us because that day could be any day of the week. So, this means that we are avaible to do more thinghs that we most enjoy or love, for example, play videogames , go to the park , take wallks and other amazing things.

Conclusion, the new proposal has a good advantages over the disadvantages. I completly agree with this and I am sure the proposal is benefial and will work for us. Also, we will save energy and resources , at the same time we gonna get benefits from it.

EF1CF9E844F7,"I believe high schools students should not be expected to stick to a career, They are barely finding themselves. Choising a career a at young age can lead to mistakes like choosing something you don't enjoy.

High Schools Program shoud be a way to help the future profesional to find what they are really want to be in the future, high school stage is one of the most important step for the young age students, Because there is when they choose their future, We need to work with them the best way is posible, We need to find out a programs that impulse them to continue students after high schools graduate.

In some case parents try to tell their children what career they have to take, In that case if the students have to choose a career by the time they are entering to the high schools, Most probably will be their parents choosed what career they are going to take it, So that may be a mistake for the student because when they finally found themself, Probably they realize there were something else more interesting for them that they could take it, At that time would be too late.

Also some students may take a career that doesn't make the money they were expecting, or choosing a career that's not fit for them,

What the high school should be concern about is to form the best profesional for the future, Teaching them the best educations is posible and the same way showing them what kinds of career are there,The advantage and the disadvantage all the career have it.

High schools programs should know they're playing a really impotant roll in the future of the country, However the programs needs to be concentrated, should be educated the young guys the best way is posible,

Create a programs to keep them away from problems like; Grugs, Alcohols, Gangs. This 3 problems are killing our new genetion, This is one of the reason why the students leave the schools at early time. Also the high schools needs to help the students to find the career that will make them be happy in the furute. Should not be the high schools expected to the students to identify a career before or at the time their are entering to the high schools.

245B5CD11772,"I beleive that if somebody wants to have succes there will always be some failure. The most important thing is that the person dosent lose there confidence or entusiasm. Ive also been through that to where I want to succead at something that I want to achieve and theres failure down the road. Once I failed I told myself to be positve about it and not just give up or get stressed about it and know that I needed to work harder at it.

There are people who want to have succes but forget that its not that easy. People have to remember that it takes time and to have patience,and stay positive. Its not easy because that person has to work hard and show effort but even after showing and doing all those things there still can be failure. When somebody fails its better to think about what can be down next time and to try harder after the first try.

Anybody could lose confidence or the energy after they keep failing but he or she forgets to see what can be down better next time. After that to check what has gone wrong and not lose confidence because eveybody has the potential to do anythung. Failure will always be there but it plays an important role for that person to remember that nobodys perfect and that theres always mistakes. The important part is to keep trying and to fix that mistake and to keep that energy up and confidence that it can be done its mot impossible.

I've also been through this to where i have a big dream and i chase after it and I think its easy but then i realized it was starting to get harder. After i tried so hard to keep working and trying i lost confidence after i kept failing again,and again. Its better to stay positive because people might say that i cant do it or many things that can cause me to lose confidence. But i choose to stay posive because i realized nobody is perfect even artist,singers,and many other things that people wanted to be because they also had mistakes and had to try harder next time. I realized after failing there were improvements better then the last time i tried and it kept happining becuase i tried harder each time but eventually i got there.

A0B2BF94231C,"First impressions are almost impossible to change. I disagree because when you look at a person for less than 6 seconds you think you know that person. Until you have a coversation with that person at least for ten mintutes. Your impression will change. However i disagree that first impressions is almost impossible to change. The reason why is that the way a person looks,personality, and their communication skills are always that change your whole point of view of that person. From your first impression, when you look at them.

However the way a person looks from your first impression isnt always who they really are. Your observation on someone aren't truely who they are. The person can be good looking person you've ever seen and you really want to meet them. Until they are the wost person, that you hate so much. This also works the other way around too, the person could be the ugliest person you have ever met, but you never gave them a chance. Thats when you realize that, that person is really good. Its also like dont judge a book by its cover. Until you actually meet that person and get to know them.

Personality can change your first impression. Personality is mostly who you are finding out, who that person is, can be life changing. For you not knowing who someone is can have a big change for you. You really dont know who you are really meeting. Personality gives great insights in that person and who they really are. Also however they want to come out to you.

Also communication is key its really important to have communication. Communication gives confidence to the other person who you are communicating with. That shows that you understand the other person and feel comfortable with them. Having good eye contact and hearing all the information of the conversation that they are giving you, makes them open more up to you.

Additionally, i disagree that the first impression is almost impossible to change. Their personality, the way they look, and communication skills can always change your whole point of view on a person. Looks can be looks, personality being honest no matter what. Communication skills are you by listening, can help you on your first impression. Therefore by taking the time, day, hours , and effort to get to know someone can benefit you from not judging a book by its cover.

Every goals that we make in our life is important to do it,even that is not like we thought. Also do our goals can affect are live psychologyly, such as can make us more confindent of ourselves. ''The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short;but setting in our aim too low, and achieving our mark."" Setting our aim too high and falling short is more important because we feel better knowing that we did our best and we can discover new things that maybe we never thought to do.

First, we feel better knowing that we did our best to make are goals,even that is not at all like we thought. When I was 11 years old and I used to play soccer, and one of my goal was to win play in a proffesional soccer team and win trophies,even that I did play for a proffesional soccer team I won many trophies. Trying to make real the goals that we used to had when we were young make us to feel proud and confident of ourselves because we never get up, always fough to do it.

Another reason, when we make our goals, even that maybe we just complete tha half of our goals;we discover new things that maybe we did not know that we can made. For example, if my dream was to be a master chef, and I work at place where a cook food to helping homeless. So, I realized that I can make my goal helping other people. When my brother was a kid, his dream was to travel around the world;even that he is pilot and only go to airport, he meet his fiance in his job. Some people may say that complete only the half of our challenging goals make us disappoined of ourselves because we did not complete. However, copmplete a challenging goals make us proud of ourselves because we are people who worked really hard and we discover many things that maybe others will never do.

Overall, we learn more doing challenging goals in our life than doing small goals that maybe everyone can do essaly.

3DFE1FE3FCE8,"Success is the most important thing in this world. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill said ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. I agree with him Because failure played a important role to be a success. Success is when people do hard work to get what they want to get from their lives. Most people want their success in school and to a dream job.

Graduating from school is the big achievement because for some people its hard to pass sol's or exam. They study hard to pass that class so they can graduate from school. Like if someone came from another country and that person does not know how to speak English. That person might fail all of the classes like English, history, and science. That person will try their best but they might not get on the first time and they will keep try until they get what they want. If some student fail there test from that failure that student know how they can fix in the next test or how they can be better then the last test. They can be more prepared.

A lot people find a job which they like to do but some people does not get their dream jobs. And some people never give up. One person who want to be a dancer but his dad does not support him. He never give up to convince his father but still his father does not listen to him. He leave his house to be dancer but after leaving the house he has nothing, he don't even have money to pay for his school, but still he never give up. He started his know dance workshop where he get money so he can pay for his school. Now he is the one of the best dance choreographer in India Remo Dsoza. When people went for job interview some people get the job on the first time. But some people have to work hard until they got the job too. They work on how they can be better next time so they can get the job.

1736153EF81F,"Well, I feel that working with a group is better than working alone. In my opinion is more easy to work with other people and you can be sociable working like that ,there's a lot benefits and reasons why I prefer more work together than work alone. Let me explain what are my reasons why I prefer work in a group and why I don't like to work alone.

First of all, I prefer work together because is more easy and you can finish your work quicky. For example, is you work in group of three, one member can search for the information about the topic, another member can make a poster showing examples about the topic and the last one has to organize how they are going to present and explain the topic. However, if I work alone I have to do all the work by my own, and it can takes a lot time to finish the project.

Second of all, Working together is so funny you can talk with your classmates about the topic, and having good discussions. I feel comfortable working in a group and I enjoy working like that, because they share their opinions with you, even you can learn more from your classmates than the information of the topic, it can be strange,but it is true you don't know how much they know about the topic. Sometimes you can't understand the topic, but you have your group and ask questions to them, and they can help you to understand the topic.

Third of all, Working in groups can be sociable, you can have a good time knowing new people and make new friends. I think is good be sociable because you can learn new things about them and you can develop your knowlege getting the new information from your classmates. For example, if you don't know anythink about history and you are in a group, and you ask who knows something about history and someone likes history you can aks him about it, and you can get new information about history and at the same time you are being sociable. However, if you are working alone, you can't ask to anybody because you dont know them.

In conclusion, that's are the reasons why I prefer working in a group. Working together can be easy you can share the work with your group, you can have a good time with your classmate talking about the topic , and you can develop your friendship making new friends.",3.5,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.5,3.2704017,3.1115484,3.285799,3.1684432,3.0713727,3.2308197,3.5532258,3.3280475,3.4346664,3.177666,3.135096,2.8327732,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,428,15,0.3294392523364486,28.53333333333333,8,2,"{'classmate', 'sociable'}"
E103955391AB,"Yeah we all have our own freedom but well that's not always true a lot of people let others control them. So it is said

Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote "" To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment""

Like i said we all have our own idividuality that what makes us we have our own way of being, own name and own way of looking we are just our selves. Specifically individuality shows us that not everything should be given to you if you want something you work hard for it but also it's a sign of your own development that you can do everthing by your self but it's because you are who you are and no one can change you. Therefore, itis proven that it's better to be individual than anybody else just giving you everything by hand .

""FREEDOM!"" is a good word all of us love to hear. When you realize you can do anything by yourself you feel like no one can stop or as free as the wind but theres always going to be obsticles without a doubt. To be Indivdual it can happen to any one such as a kid who has learned to do thier stuff alone or when you move out of your parents house and get your own home. It honestly can happen to anyone becuase thiers so many types to define the word individual. well to fell free is not a bad thing after all .

When your individual you mean something to this world because you think about yourself. You set your own goals and accomplish them and you maintian yourself the way you are it's even more better becuase it's the hugest goal anybody should have to not let anybody change you wreck all you have accomplished. To your self you feel like you value your self and it's not bad at all to value yourself because it biulds self confidence within you and that means you have you feet on the ground and yeah your ready to face any obsticale.

No one should define you except you because the world will defenitly try to change you but if you don't aceppt it won't happen like Author Ralph Waldo Emerson said ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"" whom we have someone to look up to and understand that to be inividual is okay.",2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,2.915723,2.8442705,3.0988183,3.0244763,2.883226,2.7391691,2.99307,2.9884253,3.7043922,3.5009732,3.1316047,2.5187683,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,427,14,0.4379391100702576,30.5,20,3,"{'wo', 'hugest', 'selves'}"

The issue is not all the people are doing what there ready need to do because, the people this days are doing that the thing is the best, and sometimes the best is doing what there already have done and there they never going to grow; doing things the are the are not going to help the rest of there life.

I disagree my first reason is,is you can try to do different things and help your future. My second reason is, don't be shy to do all things different. Last reason, don't be your self all the time because you never going to to know the world the you live and you never going to know your self if you never do different things.

You can try to do different things and help your future; For example if you want to do something in you life you need to start thinking about something, because in my family my sister past for the same thing the she was wasting time, but one day my mom took to her about her future if she don't start to thinking, and today she is a doctor because she stop doing the same things the she already have done.

Don't be shy to do all things different; For example my dad is was scare to do his company because he things all the work is going to be so different, and I told him if you never going to try different things we never going to grow in the future. and now we the company and the work in good, and help him a lot because hi try hard to do it.

Don't be your self all the time because you never going to know the world the you live and you never going to know your self if you never do different things; For example my mom she always said be your self all the time but one day I told her mom that is not great because if you be your self all the time you not going to rich want you want in life because your self like to do the staff the are simple are self don't like work hart to rich are gold in life.

I want to go to a university, but to achieve this goal, I have to put forth effort my going to school and studying all the time. I am always doing something while I am in school, and I am not allowed to be on my cell phone. This will not help me pass in school, even after school I sometimes stay in tutoring for Math and English, because I have trouble. This will be true in school, sports, and in life like my mother tells me all the time. I have to agree that always staying busy will allow you to accomplish more in life.

In my school, soccer also helps me stay busy, because I am on the team. We have to practice everyday to have a chance to win. I want to be the best player that I can be, and to do this I have to always practice. My coach tells me the more I practice, and the busier that I am the better condition I will be in for the game. Soccer takes a lot of energy and you are always active in the game and you need to be more active than the other team to win. Always doing something in sports allows you to be better.

My mom told me when she was growing up that she was poor, and she did not always have food to eat so she picked mangoes off of the tree. She did go to school, but when she was not in school she had to always stay busy. She would go to her grandmother's house to wash clothes or sell some of the mangoes that she picked in the street. She was fifteen years old, and she had no shoes so she worked for rich people in their house cleaning. She tells me this so that I will understand that I have to stay active and she has worked hard to give me a better life. She gets angry when I try to stay in bed and not do anything, because I always need to be active to get somewhere in life.

We achieve more when we stay active, and we always are doing something good. My goals in life are to go to school, and graduate from a college, play sports to stay in condition, and make a better life for my kids like my mother.

F094225CAE4F,"I am agree with this idea because is the best opportunity not only to the hispanic people, well for everyone who want to follow his/her dreams, and has responsability or lower resources.

I think is great idea, because some students sometime or usually work. One reason why the students do not go to the high school is because they do not have enough time to do homework, study, or just hey want to make more money.

Rarely students really want to learn, or to feel like they need to go to the college or university, cause they have a few time to go to the high school. This idea is great and amazing to someone really dream and feel that the high school is the door to the college, university, or opportunity to do your dreams real. The advantage is if you finish high school in three years you have more probability to go to the college or university. The disadvantage is that three years would be very stressing and harding time, because you need really to focus in the high school and all that stuff like: homework, worksheet, project, study, or simple attention the class. The good news is you can do anything if you have purpose, if you have motivation and completely focus in your dreams and What do you really want to be or to do?. Do not worry is you feel fear that is normal everybody feel like that about the test, high school, or dreams.

I think is a big opportunity to me; well, I work and really need pass my last year, but sometime feel like ""I cant anymore"", and I want to leave or run of the high school and just work, and work, and work, but everytime I think like that just say me "" NEVER GIVE UP "", always remember everything I did, why am i here?,and How too far wil be go for my dreams?.

Sometime the life is very unjust, cause some people have the opportunity of study withouth work, While others people do not have chooses, and that is the situation where the hispanic people live today. Well, that it's my point and why I am agree with this awesome idea. I have been thinking this system or program will be helpfull and better for every student that the system we have today. My view is if you finish the high school in three years, will be more effective, easy, and fast to be gratuated.

FA55AEEF8F9C,"Alot of people use cell phones In classrooms which I think It's a good Idea. Cellphones are use for emergencies and educational purposes. In my opinion students sometimes are given alot of work, where they have to find Information on their textbooks, or dictionary that takes almost half of the class. when they can just look it up on their phone and take about 10 to 15 minutes. Another thing is to think about are that students sometimes forget their homeworks at home and is worth half of your grade. and by having their phones with them, they can called their parents and asked them to drop up their homework at school. cellphones should be allowed in classrooms, students would be less stressed about school. They won't have to worry about carrying a heavy textbook, when they can just do their work on their cellphones. which it means, more work done and less time wasted on going page to page looking for the right answers.

Now let's talk about having a cell phone In classrooms In case of an emergnecy. One reason I believed they should allowed cellphones In classrooms because In case of a lockdown. If a student sees the person, but the police does not know how he looks like or has no idea where his at. the student can call 911 and give details of the suspect. In addition to my other reason, Students should be allowed to have their cellphone In case of an emergency call. what If something happens at home. For example, A students sibbling gets sick and doesn't stop crying until he sees one of his family. So the babysitter calls his parents, but his parents can't do anything because they can't leave work or they'll get fired. The parents would have to call the student, now the student have to leave school and take care of his sibbling.

In conclusion, I see no reason why students shouldn't be allowed to use cellphones In classrooms. schools would be more easier and safetier. you may never know what could happen and a cellphone can be a huge impact. It can save someone's life. so I think student's should be allowed to have cellphones In classrooms. sometimes students read a whole book and they dont understand it so they stop doing their work. while you can use your phone and find all the things and learn instead of reading a whole book and find most of the things you were looking for but not learning at all.

I agree to this statement because when the people have a possitive attitude they can faund a job and to have a positive attitude is very important in life and also to have a god attitude is important in the hausehold.

First: I work in a reusturant and I always have a god attitude with the costumers for example, I now a manager how work in the reastaurent she always have a negative attitude, and I think that is not god to have a negative attitude ,

to have a good attitude help a lot to have a job in my oponion a think that if I have a possitive attitude I can work very well and also a think that possitive attitude that we have is because the parents of as they teach as how we can have positive attitude .

second: I have some friends that they are negatives and that is not god we have always to are positives some people think that is god to have a negative attitude and is not real if we are negative we can do thinks bad , my mom always tell me don't be negative that is not good that why I'm always positive, my grandma always tell me don't be negative .

Third: positive actitude is good to have I think if we are happy we have a possitive attitude all people can have a positive attitude,if people don't have a posittive attitude they can't get a job that's why all people can have a possitive attitude is important if we have a positive , in all the works they need that we can have a positive attitude because in my job a girl how wants to work in their but she just went one day when my boss are treaning her she dosen't have a possitive attitude that's why a think we have to be positive always.

In conlusion if all people wants to have a job they have to learn how to have a possitive attitude if you have negative attitude plis change you attitude the negative attitude is not god in work or in oder things , we need to have positive attitude always , the positive attitude depend and how we traet oder people if you don't want to see oder people sad for you bad attitude be positve, have a positive attitude always .",3.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.3701587,2.297775,2.5932045,2.368285,2.268839,2.2349925,2.5836926,3.1792524,3.240652,3.2567828,3.0380397,2.9689348,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.5,2.0,427,6,0.2693208430913349,71.16666666666667,19,4,"{'costumers', 'mom', 'negatives', 'positives'}"
57A750437C3A,"Ralph Waldo Emerson who wrote, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greastest accomplishment"" I agree because if you do everything by yourself better things happens. Like how he saids be yourself can make you better by trying new things, so many reasons to be your own.

First of all, to be yourself can make you great life or more better can open new opportunities, by saying this a refer to get ideology with a great future. A example, making yourself with rules or putting time for something you want to do can be awesome way to start, someone told me if you fight for dreams and you really want to do it, you will get it by doing yourself. Then you can be proud of yourself by doing something the you never imaginate to do it.

Second of all, when you get staff done by your own can be a great example for so many kids in this world. Believe or not be an example for someone is the most accomplisment beacuase they want to do or be like you. Also by trying everyday something new can make you better. How this quote says "" Hard work beat talents when talents doesn't work hard"". Something useful is everyone learn new things by mistakes. Make mistakes is not a big problem, making a mistake means the you are trying to do it better and be better by learning how do it.

Third of all, the last but not least frienships have a lot with this, one question very important in here is How can I be sure the my friends are real?. Yes, probably that can be a problem that's why be yourself is the greastest accomplishment because friends can take you down with drugs, alcohol and bads things. That's doesn't mean the you can not have friends. That means you have to choose really well your friends because hypocristy exist maybe they want you down without future and great life. Hypocristy is the most danger thing in the world by hypocristy you can make people think about how they want to be or what they want to do.

In conclusion, doing yourself can make you better and open opportunites the you never imaginate. Try to do something the you love or like that's a good way to start to be yourself. Choosing what's good for you or what not and remember always fight for your dreams.

Todays technology allows people to do many different tasks without having contact with others in a positive way. Technology today is now making it easier for us humans to do things and also showing us what the furture could look like in a couple of years. Why would this be a negative thing ? if people are just trying to make are lives easier. For an example lets say you need to get some where but fast and you don't have a ride there is now a app where you send your location and give the address to place you need to go and somebody will take you. Technology is such a great thing and its becoming greater each and everyday.

There are many different types of apps that you can download on your phone today for anything. lets say that your at home and your really hungry but you don't want to leave the house you can download an app called grubhub that will make sure you dont miss a meal. what is grubhub its an app that delivers food from anywhere. All you do is tell the person what you want to eat the location of the place to pick up the food and your address so they know where to drop it off. And its that easy this thing that we call a phone can make all this happen with a little bit of typing. these apps are for free too but it may cost for the food but not everything is free in life.

Computers are also a big part of technology. Computers and laptops are used everyday could be for school for work for anything. Computers help out a lot in school for anyone who needs to do research and any type of information he or she did not know about. Laptops are great aswell its a computers that folds and is for on the go great for anyone that travels a lot or somebody that works on computers alot. Laptops are becoming better everyday there are even touch screen ones some that fold backwards and its crazy to think about because what do you think is going to happen a couple years from now technology is perparing us for the furture.

Technology is making our lives easir each and everyday. With out technology I wouldn't be able to take this take I wouldn't be able to the police if I'm in danger.

The first reason is people's communication skills will decrease over time. Spending a lot of time on technology without comminicating with others, will affect your communication skills. Therefore, talking to someone who you haven't talked with for a while can be awkward. This shows that understanding between two people might have consequence and will be not accurate than it should be.

The second reason, people who use electronic device are unlikely aware of the surroundings. For example, people who are walking in street using headset or earbuds on that cover their ears is a bad choice. This shows a sign of danger, because you won't be hearing anything. People who are aware of surrounding are more safe to cross a street and communicate with people who are passing by. This shows a negative effect of people who block their earing has higher chance to get into a accident.

Some people say that technology helps them communicate by commenting on a website which is true, but that is not important because the person will be not always active and able to comment back on time, whenever they are on. If you are communicate in person you can read the person's mood. You can get a faster respond than waiting for the person to comment back. In this way is more accurate and able to trust each other more by communicating in person that you have meet or have not meet before.

The final reason is library is more accurate than reading books online. For example like reading online recommendation is not always accurate because of the people's preferance. You can ask the librarian for recommendation and librarian also assist you whenever you need help. You can read on your device but it is limited because of the battery. Unlike books, have no battery which means it doesn't have any limit. This shows reading on books is a better than reading on a device.

In conclusion technology had a negative effect on people lives. People should be aware that around them and spend their time in their technology on a necessary way. There should be a limit of how much time you are using on technology. Is better to communicate in person and don't wear anything that cover your ears while talking to someone. This affect our daily lives, so limit the time you use in technology.",3.5,3.5,4.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5481849,3.38385,3.5500262,3.4307184,3.2444148,3.5568676,4.285972,4.232017,4.6070647,4.222645,3.757987,3.9076443,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,443,27,0.4108352144469526,16.40740740740741,5,5,"{'headset', 'earing', 'online', 'wo', 'website'}"
C51C5EA029D6,"There are many other ways, how we can choose our character traits. The first way is to choose our own character traits, by picking it for ourself. The second way is our character formed by influences beyond our control, by not being able to control it. The most reasonable character trait would be choosing our own character trails, because it makes the most sence out of all and most of the population can control on their emotions.

There are different types of character traits, for example funny, exiciting, joyful, and many more. Our character traits are formed by our own influence and by our own actions. That's what causes them to react from different types of emotions. For the most part, we are able to control our emotions, but sometimes we cannot control over them so they go out of control.

Character traits can be used in many different ways. However, there are some character traits that we can't control, it would happened to us by itself because we sometimes don't have control on ourself. For example anger, sadness, and depression are the reasons why we lose control sometimes because we are unable to control over it. These emotions can be dangerous once you are out of control, you don't even know what you will be doing, it could be something really terrible. That's the reason character traits can be good or bad sometimes.

Some people support the fact to pick there character traits for themself, some think it's not in our control and we are unable to control it. The people that said they decide to choose the character traits for themself, say when they do something they can feel the emotions in contol of them and do what best fits them. On the other hand, the people that think the charater traits is not in there control, say if they are working or doing anything the emotions of them just happens and they can't control it. In most of the cases it is caused by the bad emotions like being mad, or sad and more.

There are many more reasons of people talking about character traits. Not all of them are good nor not all of them are bad. It mainly depends on the person who is controling it. For the people that are unable to do so can control over it by doing couple simple things and not letting there emotions take over them. That's why controlling you're own character traits is different than having it controlled by some formed influence.",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.4640439,3.3556964,3.5163352,3.4433823,3.333026,3.4195354,3.1409903,3.315044,3.7449975,3.5030334,3.765256,3.4439251,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,434,22,0.3709677419354839,19.727272727272727,10,3,"{'ourself', 'trait', 'joyful'}"

Although Thomas Jefferson says if inactivity also serve a purpose in life, in my opinion, when you do not do anything you will never get a result of good things always we have to try to do some effort to be someone in life.

In addition, According to the prompt and ""determine never to be a idle"". I have never been idle in life, because i always do my responsibilities and i try to not be lazy, some times i also help other peoples cause we need to be good with others no matters how they are with us.

Duke Ellington said "" A problem is a chance for you to do your best"". A problem can present in any ocattion but is inportant for you to not give up to keep trying and to make that problem a new chance were you can try something new.

Being able to show your solving a skill can also help you in any ocattion. If you are able to show that you can solve anything and take risk to solve tha problem that can be an inportant step for you to take and try to flip that problem to something good . Show your skill show that you can keep trying and try your best to solve that problem wich can take a long time to do but by showing things can also help you in your future.

studys show that solving a problem can increase your brain knowledge imagene if in stead of solving a problem you can flip it into a good thing, and also help in the future. a problem can come from diffirent situation and from different topics which can help increase your knowlegde in that certain topic what happens if you try something new and it fails that can also can make you or can break you. it can break you in the form that you stop tryingand give up or it cna make you if you dont let that problem take control of you and you take your time to solve it or turn it into chance.

do your best to solve that problem or take that chance or turn it into a lelarning process that you know you try ur best and you know you took your time to solve that problem and you can have that expirience in your mind and you know you learn a lot from thatt chance that was once a problem but knowing is a learning expirience. All that you learn can help you in the future. and I agree with what duke ellington said a problem can be a chnce of learning.

making a mistake or having a problem fail can teach you a lot of thing were you can learn from your failing expirience it can sometimes ruin your expirience but at the end of the day you learn from that mistake.

Nothing can make you stronger then failure. It make's you more success In life, even helps you to learn a life lesson, that you can do much more then what you could image to build your life and happens.

When you did something and It makes you failure don't think that why did that happened, or why did you do that although, give up that you can't solve It, you should know and everyone else that we all are strong we will not know until failure comes to you that you are much stronger and be powerful with what you have and what come's to you

Nothing Is more Important then success your life, sometimes failures and make you life hard but It can make your life more powerful, that you will trust yourself and, It will make you stronger and you will take more responsibility for your next steps. For example, my father would tells me all the time that when you get older have your on business and you need to be strong If your not strong ""failures"" can heart you so that's why you need to work so hard and be strong as will to reach your goals. Although even If you have a good life don't think that's It that you will not have any problems anymore. If you don't work hard and not be strong failure can make your life so harder

On the other hand, life is a lesson and challenge for everyone It can take a risk so you need to be strong for what ever come to you and be powerful for not any failures so to you and break you. For example, my mom would tell me life Is a lesson each day you will learn something different and you will get stronger so you don't know when and what will happen to you so mantle and physically be strong. However If you did something learn you mistake lesson to not do It again and forget the mistake.

However, It's not good to have failure some people can't handle It so they kill them self. On the other hand, failure Is good because they know how strong and powerful thy are and nothing can break you or failure you.

Being powerful and strong Is so Important so that life will change you no matter.

D35A126B4379,"Anyone can have a talent or skill, you just need to see what it is. They can help along the way to get you something really helpful, for example collage. Your talent can be playing an instrument, singing, or dancing. A skill can be building things, sports, and cooking. The talent I have is playing a Guitar because it took time, practice, and studying.

When you want to do something big it can take a lot of time. Time is what we all need and time can go fast or slow, but thats good because it can really be helpful. Playing the Guitar took a while but it payed off, mostly because I used my free time to play. Sometimes I can get stress playing mainly by not having much time playing before a concert. It could be hard doing it ,but by doing so I can see my self getting better each day.

Practicing could get hard, but if your relax and not think too much you'll see it will be easy. Practicing can make you accomplish anything you've been doing a long time. Doing the Guitar was hard but not too hard because I've been practicing for a while. Playing some of the songs were fast and long, but when I got home I'd play the song over and over until I got it just right. Thats how I know by practicing is really helpful and made me be good at doing the I wanted to do the most in life.

Some people don't like to study and its not something we have to do, but something we need to do. I think studying is more of a thing you want to do if you care so much about what your doing. Studying the notes was one of the first things I had to do before playing the Guitar and the songs. By studying I can see the notes were not that easy to play and also tuning the Guitar, but thats why I studied to see what I was doing wrong. Studying is what I did to be fantastic at the Guitar also being amazing at the concerts.

In conclusion, If you want to be awesome at what your doing you need to use your time wisely, practice, and study. By doing all that you'll see that you will be amazed at what you did. Maybe you can even be famous for what you did by focusing on your goal. To sum this all up just do at what you do best in life maybe it can pay off real good.``",3.0,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5053463,3.4358177,3.5706842,3.5530567,3.497813,3.526202,3.4993494,3.3486288,3.4282558,3.3653858,3.5032682,3.3862429,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,440,24,0.4068181818181818,18.33333333333333,5,2,"{'payed', 'tuning'}"
7D94F809823A,"Many people agree, that the use of technology brings a positive impact by allowing people to complete many task like. looking for information, buying a book,

buying video games, and shopping. and looking for technology as a way to communicate which can limit the opportunities to use verbal communication.

I strongly disagree with this statement on the use of technology, because it limits the amount of outside interactions and technology can do everything for you. For example, now people mostly use text as a way to communicate with someone through social media. using only this form of communication can limit the use of verbal communication with a person. Resulting in negative relationships with a person causing misunderstandings and negative relationships. avioding verbal interactions is very bad for somone. Technology can also be damaging for the health.

Technology be both physically and emotionally unhealthy. For Instance the use of so much technology can damage the eyes and can cause brain damage this can result to unhealthy problems in the future. On the other hand people think that by using there phones, tablets and computers. They do not have to be mobile and do a task by themselves with no technology. By sitting around and not getting up to go out and finish a task can lead to loss of energy and many other physical problems. The lack of day to day verbal communication can cause negative emotions. For instance not verbally talking to people can make someone feel lonely and unhappy.

Using technology as a way to purchase things and avoiding to go to the stores can have some negative outcomes. For Example purchasing an electronic on a website and having it delivered it can result to being broken, missing pieces, and can be the wrong thing this can lead to loss of money and can lead to no possible refunds. people use this as way to shop for food, clothes, and books instead of being able to feel the object or know the quality of the item it self or asking an employee about the items pros and cons.

In conclusion, Many people agree that technology allows them to complete many tasks without having to come in contact with others. as a result Technology has a negative impact on people limiting contact with person to person resulting to negative impacts on there day to day life, Although, technology is smart it is always best idea is to be able to do things more off technology and using more verbal communication with a people rather then a phone or computer using verbal communication is a best way to being positive out comes and being able to go to a store instead of relying on technology.

5DD1954E47A8,"How old were you when you decided what you wanted to do for a living? Some schools are requiring students to choose their career before entering high school, witch shouldnt be done. Although it is understandable that students know witch career path they would like to take to start preparing early. Students should not be choosing their careers at a young age as they are to young and inexperienced with the world, should be more focused on enjoying their childhood and lastly should work up slowly to decide what they would like to be when they grow up.

Students before high school are to young to choose a career path, as they most likely do not have much responsibilities. For example a child with little experience on responsibility might choose a career that requires you to be very responsible. The child with little experience on responsibility will quickly be stressed and overwhelmed and will most likely under preform. An older student will have more responsibilities and will have more experience, most likely will choose a career that will be a better fit for them and require responsibilities they are comfortable handling.

Young students shouldn't be extremely focused on what career path they want to take. They should be more focused on enjoying their childhood. By engaging in extracurricular activities such as: sports, music, reading and acting. By participating hobbies they enjoy being a part of. The students will explore and experience more witch will help them as they get older in choosing what they like and what they would like to do for living by simply having fun. As we only have one childhood and we shall enjoy it while it last.

A way of introducing careers to young students without making them commit to a specific one. Is having classes in schools that teach a specific career such as: construction, engineering, agriculture and law enforcement. By providing classes like this to children they will be open to explore new things without committing to one career. Slowly introducing different careers to students by having extra classes. Is a good way for them to start thinking about their future without making them choose one specific career.

Overall students at a young age should not be choosing their careers. It its way to much stress for a child. They are way too inexperienced in responsibility. Should be focused on enjoying their childhood. Introducing different careers at a young age without making them commit is helpful way. This will slowly introduce them to different careers without making them commit to one and risk stressing them out.

Behave when you are in the halls. when the bell rings, and you are dismissed, go to your other class immediately. Don't take a walk around the school, go to the gym, or cause a traffic by standing in the halls and talking to your friends. It's not a safe nether is it responsible. Keep your hands to your self, unless if it's an activity that allowed you to touch the other students or even staff members with adult supervision.

Behave in the cafeteria. Once you are in line to get your food, you should respect others by waiting your turn. This isn't only respectful, but it's even a good habit. Walk back to your seat, don't run. Running could cause for you to spill your food, and someone could slip and that resulting in an injury. When you finish your food, cleanup after your self if necessary.

Behave when you are on the school bus. When you are on the bus it's nice of you to greet your bus drive, but you don't have to. Quietly walk to an open seat and sit down. Sit with your grade level. Once settled, you could quietly talk to the person sitting next to you, don't yell across the bus. On the bus it is important for the bus driver to be able to see from the back window or door to prevent car accidents, don't put your stuff in the middle of walkway. If you are going to be eating on the bus, which you are not aloud, unless the bus driver said so, clean up any mess that you may have caused.

Showing responsible and appropriate behaviors could make teachers more flexible with any other improper behavior that you may cause. For an example, you are a bad student, you were late to class, and you decided to run. The teacher catches you, and you get in trouble.

AC3111702C95,"First impressions are always important and can really effect how you are looked at but they are not impossible to change. They impact whether you get the job, make that friend or even if you get service if you are somewhere. I believe that first impressions are not impossible to change, they are hard but not impossible. Firstly, because someone could always forget, people can change, and you could receive a second chance to redeem yourself.

I have met people a second time that either I had a bad first impression with or they did and we forgot all about it. When you forget about somebody, the first impression with obviously not matter. You will forgive and forget. Also when I say the word ""forget,"" I do not mean completely lose all knowledge of the other person, but I mean maybe you did not care or maybe the first impression was not terrible that it was easy to block from your memory.

I have changed and many people in my life have also changed. Your first impression or somebody else's first impression might change if you meet them again in five to ten years. Over a period of time if let's say somebody who had a bad job interview wants to change and really wants the job, they will change and they will ask for another opportunity. Even if you have a bad encounter with someone the five times you have met them, your opinion about them will change with just one good impression. People change and when they do, so do impressions.

Second chances are also very important with impressions. Redeeming themselves is something a lot of people tend to do. Chances are not hard to ask for, and when making it up to somebody for a bad impression, you need to make it count. I have asked several people for second chances to redeem myself for bad impressions and now, we are friends. When I first applied to my first job, I was late to my interview and that is why I did not get the job. Then I asked my boss for a second chance, he gave it to me and now I have an amazing job.

In conclusion, no, first impressions are not impossible to change because there is forgetful people, people change and second chances exist. It is not hard to be on your best behavior or to be well dressed when meeting someone new, especially if they are of higher authority. First impressions are not impossible but are difficult to change, that is why it is good to try and make a good first impression to save you from trouble.",4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,3.769397,3.763983,3.8870075,3.863199,3.8996964,3.834811,3.6602435,3.442749,3.570585,3.0709403,2.9512663,3.3388822,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,448,22,0.3950892857142857,20.363636363636363,1,4,"{'firstly', 'redeeming', 'forgetful', 'redeem'}"

People who change for others . There is a lot of ways to become you.

When you know who you want to be as a person thats when you pick up traits. When you want to be something you start learning things. You can't have character if you don't want to be someone. Character traits are things people notice about you. Like right now there are to Women right now one is dressed nice has done her hair. She like to be fancy she blow her nose outside. She teaches Spanish I think so she travels for sure. She actually beautiful so you know she married. This another women is dressed causal and is wear a school jacket. She has a bun

But seems to be nice. She teaches science she most be smarts.

You thoughts of a lot of traits for them. How do you think they built them. They lived in different house and different schools and have a lot of different traits. Everyone can different trait and same one. You can never find someone with all the same traits. People see them in other and copy. People learn from them selves and make them. Traits are something you learn and keep.

Now if traits were something beyond your control thats different. If something beyond are control was doing this you'd think different. If you are talking about TV thats cool yeah I think so but not like that. TV is kinda like school but a lot of different things. You learn a lot of things from the TV that aren't the same. So you build off that. If you are talking like someone controlling of thats a whole different story. People would be more a like and thats how you tell we are in control.

This Philosopher,Albert Schweitzer illustrates that an ""Example Is not the main thing In influencing others;It Is the only thing."" Although setting an example by your own behavior Is a good way to Influence other's; Their's still better and different way's to Influence people. Not all people have bad behaviors because of somebody close to them; A son could be a good and humble and the people around him could only have negativity.

There are different ways such as sitting down with someone and giving advice about good behavior and what their currently doing wrong In the present. Schools even teach about It and have group of students learn about whats good and bad. In health class they are teaching about having a healthy life to be prepared in life and for whats coming In the future. Although there are example's out there like famous people that motivate others to go the same path they went,Also a good example but those are not the only way's; There are teachings or parents giving advice to have a better behavior,psychologists who people can tell whats going on in their life and they get a response of what they can do.

Somebody,Anybody can demonstrate they were a good example to somebody but at the end not everybody turns out to be like them. A son can be good and humble while the people close to him or that he admires have a lot of negativity. Anybody could sit down with somebody and talk about about what there doing wrong and they could be doing the same thing;That dose not make them a good example but at least they give advice,ideas, and reveals to that person a new pathway they can take to do better. Teachers who teach about It can fill them with information they didnt know about having a healthy life; That teacher could be doing everything wrong and be negative which makes her a bad example to everybody but the students get the good advice to be better.

There are people who leave good examples for others to follow but is It also the only thing.

Certainly, many different things can influence us. Such as trends, for a couple of weeks, months or years. Many different things could be could be trending. Like different genres of, movies, music, or video games, even clothing. In the moment when those things are popular it might feel amazing to own those particular things. Many people who cant afford things of such nature such as the latest cars, jewelry, and brands like Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Moncler, or anything of type nature that is trending. People like teens or young adults might feel terrible because their friends could be having those things and they cant afford it, and when they get some money they might go and spend it on expensive things to fit in. But as you get older, and the trend is over, most people regret spending a lot of money on things they didnt need. After the trends die out and everybody moves on to the next set of trends. People will start maturing and decide to wear, listen to, and do their own things, instead of being just like everybody else.

Most people, if not everyone would prefer doing things they like rather than doing things they dont like because their friends want to do it. A majority of people in the world have made themselves who they wanted to be. Every persons interests can influence them more than any person or friend. If it wasnt for peoples interests, and wanting to be themselves whether they were accepted or not. Most famous people wouldnt be where they are today. A lot of people use their interests to get them out of bad situations, which brings me to my final paragraph.

Following your dreams and being true to yourself can take you a long way. Although when people think of chasing their dreams, they picture being rich, famous, and living in a mansion. Others may think of starting a business with things they have a passion for and enjoy. Even having a daily basis of clients/ customers, even if its 5-10 people a day. At some point if that person stays consistent and humble, something big may happen for them and their business can just become huge, and they could keep on growing and having people who also share the same interests could come in on a regular basis.

6B3B3CB54EB9,"My opinion about conserve energy and resources.

I have two points of view, the bad and the good one. I think this is a good idea but, it has bad things.

I think if we want to conserve energy and resources we just need to have four-day school week. Four-day school week can be benefits for the people that have to work everyday, but it has a disadvantage and is that we are not going to learn to much like a five-day school week.

My first point of view is that this can be good for many students. If my school follow this system can work for many students that have to work every day. First reason is that they can have one school-day off so they can go calm to the job. They can have that day off in school and job. Second reason is that, this can be good also for those students that skip school everyday, maybe if they know that we just got four-day school week they would want to come to school. Third reason is that teachers can have more time to work on projects and do all that work that they have to do.

Second point of view is that is system can not be a good idea. First reason is that students would not learn as much as five-day school week. Second reason is that is going to be tired to be ten hours of school. Third reason is that two more hours of school are not a good idea for those that have a part-time, they would not be on time in their jobs. Two more hours of school can be frustrate for many students.

My position on this issue is that this would not work. First reason is that many students that have to work they would like to go to school beacuse of two more hours. students that have to work start they shift at 5 pm and school would end at 6:04 pm, students would skip the last classes. I think if this is to conserve energy and resources it would not work beacuse is like they are adding part of the last day of school to each day so like the same think.

My conclusion is that is not a good idea my school sould not approve this issue. This like the same think as five-day school week. If they don't add two more hours this maybe can work, but I think this going to be hard for students and teachers. With this system we are not going to conserve energy and resources is going to be the same thing.

BB5B58E098AB,"Well i think we choose our own character traits,because its up to you what you want to do, we choose if we want to be happy,sad,or angry. I've learned that with my mom,she always tells me,""you choose to be happy,sad,angry""

Sometimes our character is formed by influences beyond our control,and that's okay everyone has diffrent reasons to be mad or to be sad,happy but we can change it if we want to. The British naturalism and politician John Lunnock was right about what he wrote,this helps a lot of people to understand that if someone do,did,say,or have said something to you ,it'll be our choice to get mad,sad,or just ignore what happened..

After that your character it'll be what you choose to make it.

For example,i've been trought a lot this past years ,my chilhood was not the best i did not had a father or my mom when i was a little girl,i grew up with my grandparents my uncle raped me when i was seven years old,my other unclu he used to hit me all the time in my head,my grandma used to hit me with the belt , i was fat when i was a little girl,and people used to make fun of me,

That really affect me ,because i'm unsecure about my body,or how i look,i've in Hospitals because i try to kill myself last year,because i was depressed,because all the things that i've been trought and now i choose to be happy,im going to therapits on Monday's,i started working ,i play soccer,or i go out with my sister.

I have choose to be happy .

Sometimes it's hard to be happy,even that you know you want to be happy you just don't see one reason to be,and it's sad because you know your family it's feeling the same pain you feel inside of you ,the only thing you think in those moments are, ""why would i do this"" or ""why am i trying so hard "" .

Those are the worst feelings,when you want to get up in the morning but you can't.

15968BD9B40A,"Some schools have programs where younger students can work with older students. For example, At my school there's homework club right after school. Teachers of all sort of subjects come to the libary and help out with your questions. The teachers also let you communicate with any grade level students. So I think that students of all ages should interact with each other.

So I think it can help younger students understand if they can't capture the meaning or they need an older student to clarify for them. Because younger students look up to the older students. Meaning that when there the oldest in the school or one of the oldest, they can help out kids/students who need help and use the same strategy that the older student tought them when they we're younger. So then, the younger students would always wanna go to the programs that the older students go to for some help.

It benefits for the older students because, For example, If one of the students wanted to become a teacher and is really shy, Then they can work on their communication skills on the younger students and become more secure about them selves and become a teacher. For example, When they were teaching they young ones, they could use that exact same stragety when they were ""teaching"" when they were young.

It defenitly can help both because, It can help with communitcation skills and meet new people you've never meet i your life, And then later on in the future you'll become really good friends with them. This can help out a lot not only one way but a lot, Because if you're the young one then you still have a long way to go. And if you're the older one then if you thought you can pursue your teaching carrear then you still have a chance to be a teacher in life.

In conclusion, My essay was yes. Why? Because some younger students parents didn't go to school, or finished school. So they have no one to ask for help. But this isn't only for homework club, this can be for any activty or program there's in the school. It can be sports,cooking, teaching, ect. For example, If you played a sport and you were the youngest, you can ask the oldest for help. Like how can i improve my skills, or how can i improve my passes, ect. So yes I think all schools should let every age group in a certain activity or program.

Yes, I think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Less take me as an example; I had personal problems before, and It was auwefull. What If It was so bad that I couldn't go to school?! Some students are just not good at school, and just prefer learning from home online or by video conferencing. Other students that gets in trouble all the time are just better off learning from home. There, at home, there is no one to to fit with.

Most of the times our parents say that going to school and socialism is good for us. Is that true?! Is that the case?! Well I am not sure about that, but what I do know is that I think we students should have the options to decide what we really are confortable with, and our parents should help us with that.

We all need to turn in our work on time or it will be counted late, same test, same quiez everything.

a positive attitude is the key to success in life because they has positivism,life challenge,and people are secure of them self.

First,A positive attitude is the key to success in life because they has positivism. For example, Generic_Name is a person who always think positive in his life,school,and his work. that is why he is not afraid for any challenge in his life.

I want to flip flop houses so I want to learn more about this and I want the manager of the business pick us so we can learn how those a work.

One reason, That you should pick us is how do you know if the house is good to flip and know if you going to make more money. People think that you should look in area that are growing and get house that are bad and flip the house so you can sell it for more and get more money then you payed the house and the things that made the house better.

Second reason, the manager should pick our class so we can learn How does the business work like how many house do you need to buy so that the work proceed and process. I heard that people buy three house each 6 mouth so they can work on it because some houses take one month and other houses take 4 month. Then you got to wait for the houses to sell that can take weeks or even months to sell the house to get the money.

third reason, That the manager should pick us that we want to know that if the wait of getting the money is worth it by waiting to the house to can be ready and wait so the house can get sold. People I heard that money that you wait six mouth is worth it because the money that the person get back is like more twenty thousand more on the house that you can buy a better house in a better place or keep some money. The money that you get can make a lot.

That why the manager of the real state business should pick us to visit and learn about the work because students want to learn more about this job and have question more so in the future that students will know about more then the job and maybe in there life working in this area so they can make money to.

In my position I think it's a great idea to attend classes from home only if you work, or if you can handle any type of work by yourself without a person that will persuade you to do the work, and if you know English perfect.

I think that some students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Because for some students it's difficult to wake up early because some students who work on

Part-times, and some students don't want to wake up early, or they go to bed late for playing games on their phones.

Secondly. I think that some students might benefit from this program if they can handle any type of work independently without a teacher or any person persuading them to do the work, because some students are smart and they like to work independently, in silence, without people disturbing thems or without too much explanations.

Also. I think that the only students that can understand any work and can only attend classes from home, are those who knows English Perfect, because if you know English perfect then you can work in any topic or subject without the help of anybody, If you are a Hispanic born in other country then this program it can work for some Hispanic students because they are used to get everything easy, to get what they want without making a effort.

In the other hand, I think that this program it won't help to those students who distract easy or those who don't do work without any person who will persuade them to do the work, because there are students who likes everything easy, students who don't want to make an effort, this program it won't work to those students who don't like to study, to those who have only F on their classes or those who are skipping, or not going to school.

In conclusion I think this program can only help those students who can handle any kind of work without the help of any person. and for those students who have dreams, those who makes a effort to get what it can help thems in the future, for those that knows that life it's not easy, to those students that know that if you don't work for it you won't get what you want on life. those students who can handle any kind of work without the help of any person.",2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.1654356,2.9858797,3.2088385,3.0720549,3.008299,3.1741762,3.3590593,2.5629659,3.0911858,2.7933588,2.4969873,2.97294,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.0,2.5,2.0,454,13,0.3017621145374449,34.92307692307692,5,6,"{'distract', 'conferencing', 'video', 'online', 'wo', 'skipping'}"

Therefor you can check out books from your phone and read from your book on your phone. also you can book a hotel room from the technology now days or you can also take pictures and send them to your love ones.

Another example can be that where ever you are in the world you can order anything from online store.

Like makup kits, dresses or other things from the online store. Also you can purchase movie tickets , zoo tickets or you can go on a cruise with family. Also you can purchase tickets to travel to your dream country and do fun stuff there.

Technology is also bad , because what ever you post on social media it will go everywhere and everone would see what are you doing and what are you up to basically the photos you take of yourself and you post it on social media the people are going to see it and it probably hurt you future career or your job that you are in. Also technology is bad , because people out there are literlly photshoping what ever you post basically girls , because they do inpropreate things with the photos of girls.

Another example of why is technology is bad. It's bad , because of cyberbullying. People bully other people on social media and the people who are getting bullied can't do anything ,because the people who are doing bullying. they don't know who they are if the people who are getting bullied said something to the bully they will do something wrong with them.

So that's why technology is good and bad try to avoid these things lif you want to post something out there just be aware of those people who do all these kind of things like cyberbulling and photoshopping. The good thing can be that make a personal file and keep the photos or only send to your family members and try to avoid social media,",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0257072,2.9215598,3.1685195,3.0438123,3.0051422,2.8717036,3.1218007,2.8713274,2.8127496,3.021948,2.5932317,2.7237992,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,447,19,0.3982102908277405,23.526315789473685,18,7,"{'bullied', 'therefor', 'bullying', 'kits', 'online', 'birthdays', 'cruise'}"

People don't conseve their energy and resources in the way that people get tired daily. Nonetheless, there are some businesses had the idea to work four days per week each day consistenting of ten hours. As well as, schools should follow this project by extending the school day two hours. In my opinion, school should follow this great idea because students can do differents routine, be less stressful, and get better grades.

To begin with, the majority of students do the same rutine daily some enjoy to play sports on the school. Whereas, someone will like to try another kind of sport outside the school but they don't have sufficient time to do it. Elsewhere, if the school follow extending the school day and leaving one or two days off students can do different rutine and have thier own space. All in all, students can try different sports with their families or friends outside of school. In others words, doing differents routine will help the energy and resources for students.

Second reason, for some students is stressful go to school everyday. As well as, some has to work to late, or do homework, or has problent to get sleep at night. If this happend during this time they loss their energy and is difficult for student to focus on their class. However, students that are stressful can have health problem. In other case, students can be less stressful and active if their sleep more such as, if they get two days off of the school they can repose their tiredness and get energy.

Lastly, the energy and resources are a important priority for a student. Likewise, that all students do their homework and be on time in their class. nevertheless, the majority of the students has problem be on time or do homework some of them miss school days just because they didn't do their homework. Altogether, durin this days off students can do their homework with resources, patience and dedication. After all, this could help student to have better grades.

To conclude, the priority for people life is to conserve energy and resouces. Rather, we are on time to help our students's health. Lately, doing different rutine will help us to progress and be healthy. If we are healthy we are less stressful we will be with energy.

6A00BED6B62D,"Do you think it is a good idea for students to start their career such a young age and stress about it? I will tell you guys why it is not a good idea. Reason number one students can feel a lot of pressure on them. Reason number two students still do not know what them want to be yet.

Students can get a lot of pressure because students have not found out what they want to do in life. Students can get over welled so easily. Students think about it to much what they want to be when they grow up. Especially freshman they just stated school they do not need any stress when it comes to think about their career. Freshman do not what they want to be yet. They are just new kids that have just stared high school and they do not need to think about it yet. Students already have enough stress and, they do not need anymore of that. Students already have stress from school, sports, home problems, and the list can go on.

Students still do not know what them want to be yet. It is hard to find something want you like to do in life as your career such as a young age. Students may thing they have found the one that they really want to do in life but, they change their mind and, they what want to go for the other career. Therefor, students need more time to think about what they want to do in life. It takes time to think about what students what to be to grow up. There is a lot of things to do for your career so students just have not found the right one yet. They need time to make sure what they really want to do in life and they feel it is the right one.

Some might says it is a good idea for students to commit a career such a young because it will benefit them in life. Here it is were I am go to prove them wrong. Students get stress so easily and they do not need any more of that. Students do not need to feel pressured and it is okay to say that they do not know what that want to be when they grow up. It is not okay to rush students as they enter high school. Students can make their own mind when the thing it is the right time and, also they think they really think what they want to be when they grow up just give them time.

The role is something that consists in a good jod but you have to know how you use because if you don't know how you use your role is going to failure or if some people that you have don't know use that thing. But if that happend don't loss the enthusiasm because if you want that you role going up and make more money or others things, don't loss the enthusiasm and you have to study more about role for learn more and for that you role don't going failure because in you role you can do new things, and you can do jobs with others people that have role you can work with they like a group and work for a big company where the can pay you much money and with that you can do another company more big by yourself about role or if you want to you can do a different company that you like it you can do a better jod only you have to learn more about the job that you want to take always if you want to take a good job you have to study first before you take the job like when you study more about role because if you don't study more for different job you job is going to failure like the role always happend in jobs that you don't know use but never loss the enthusiasm if you like the role, or others things.

The enthusiasm is something like when do you like something like a better jobs, role, or others things that you like to do that's enthusiasm or when you like to do a good mechanic or a good doctor and you say i going to do this because i like it is my dream do a good doctor or a good mechanic or others things but that's the enthusiasm do something that you like to do and never loss the enthusiasm because if you loss the enthusiasm you never going to do anithing that you want or that you like don't loss the enthusiasm never do like Churchill's he never loss the enthusiasm because he want to keep up with the role and he like the role he study more and he learn more about role.

0A8B8F282E45,"Winston Churchill once said ""success consists of going from failure to without loss of enthusiasm."" In other words, sometimes failure teach us how to get at the success. Many people agree with this statement, others disagree with it. It's easy to see both sides, but one stand out. Success is necessary consists of going from failure because failure teach us how to be better and create responsibility.

First, failure teach us how to be better, for example if I did a song to someone important to see and this person didn't like it; I won't give up even if is the worse song ever because the failure will show how to learn better and if you wont give up and always try the best you will get the success. As you can see you always have to do your best to get your success even if is the hardest thing. however, most of the famous had failure. it wasn't easy to get where they are; maybe can take long time to be like they are, but is hard. Most of the times is difficult to get the success that they have; they have that success because they never give up even if was the worse song or if they were failure.

Next, failure make you create responsibility, for example if you are a failure on something and want to be better, you always will try something new to get better and try your best, that's mean responsibility to yourself,

for example if I want to get my drive license and I fell many times, I can be a failure on it, but if I create responsibility and study every day I will do good and pass with success. If I speak another language and my

English is a failure I will be responsive and study to understand the people and do well on my classes. As you can see, always have a way, we learn with failure to be better then you were

On the another hand, some people believe we never have to have failure in our success, because failure can a negative in your life and in your life you always have to be have to be positive; this point make sense, but in life we always have to learn something. Therefore this statement is right because success consist of going from failure.

In conclusion, many people think that success don't consists of going from failure because it's a negative thing in our life, but success is necessary consist going from failure, because failure teach how to get the success in life, how to be better, and how to be more responsive in life.",3.0,2.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.06006,2.8940506,3.1415627,2.984479,2.7903373,3.0495753,3.101103,2.9399889,3.1974242,3.038578,2.9132833,3.3935454,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,453,15,0.3377483443708609,30.2,4,2,"{'wont', 'wo'}"
AC6348A7ECB4,"SOME SCHOOLS OFFER DISTANCE LEARNING AS AN OPTION FOR STUDENTS TO ATTEND

CLASSES FROM HOME BY WAY OF ONLINE OR VIDEO CONFERENCING. DO YOU THINK

STUDENTS WOULD BENEFIT FROM BEING ABLE TO ATTEND CLASSES FROM HOME:

Some schools offer distance learning as an option for student to attend classes from home by online or video conferencing. Parents do not want their children to attend classes from home. Students will not get much benefits, whoever if they live in a place that is far away from school or they can't attend school for any reason then its has benefits. I'm not agree that students should attend classes from home because students can have stress, students can not pay attention very well, and the most important fact is that it will affect on students' grades.

The first reason is that the students can get stressed everyone time whenever they attend the class online because i know that its not easy to take classes online. students have to pay more attention. They can not understand very well by online or on video conference. It will be hard for students to learn or to understand their lesson online. Students will be stressed out because no one will be there to help them, not any teacher and either any friend (any other student).

The second reason why students should not take classes at home is that they will not able to pay attention by taking online classes. it does not feel like the school environment. students will spent more time on their school. At least in schools we pay more attention than doing our homework at home, because we mostly spend our time on our devices (cell phone) and on the television by watching episodes, cartoon movies, other movies, and etc.

The third reason is that it also affect on students grades and in the future they can not attend their favorite college. They won't able to understand the lesson, they will get bad grades in all subjects. It is so important to attend the classes at school, then you will know what is going on. students can ask teachers if they are having problems in their lesson. teachers can help them during school timing or after school. It will be easy for students to understand or to pay attention and they can get good grades too in all their subjects.

Students should not take classes at home. It will affect on their grades because they will not able to pay attention, they will get stressed out because if student need help, no one will be there to help them for their studies or their lessons, and it will be hard to pay attention at house by doing online studies.

EA857E7CEFD9,"I disagree with my school adding one and a half more hours for these reasons there is no time for after school activities, going to have to give the teachers more, and your going to have to face a lot of students sleeping in class because lets admit it school is kind of boring.

One reason the school board shouldnt add one and a half more hours is because there will be no time for after school activities. For example if Generic_Name has soccer practice anymore. Another example is if Generic_Name hosts computer club she cant host it because there is no time for hosting her club. Another example is if they and one hour and a half then there would be no time to have fun at school.

The second reason the school board should not add one hour and a half is because your going to have to give the teachers more money for the extra hours. An example is that if there child is sick and they need to pick them up but they cant because they are teaching. Another example is if Generic_Name is the boss of the school board and the extra one hour and a half she is going to have to do extra work so she make sure that everyone gets there pay check. Another example is teachers are going to have to make sure they have enough work for the extra time and plus they have to grade all of the work the students do. The last example is that the bell schedule will be different and the people who work are going to do a lot of work to schedule lunch and everything.

Another reason i disagree with my school adding one hour and a half more time is that the teachers are going to have to face a lot of tied and sleeping students. Another example is if half of the students are sleeping and tiered there is no point of teaching them because they are likely not going to do work or forget everything they learned that day. Another example is that the teachers will be angry from all the students with their heads down because they are tiered. Another example is that students and teachers have family and places to be. Another reason there shouldnt be one hour and a half is that everyone has their schedules like for example shower,homework,eat,sleep and they wont have time to do all of their schedule

Kids would rather be at home then have to go to school at seven in the morning. They're different kinds of people out there who would stay at home just because they didn't feel like getting up so early in the morning. Other kinds where kids put effort into going to school. I don't think working from home is a good idea for school students.

There are some kids that can't really work at school, but then they're others that just do it for fun. By saying how kids take advantage is because some of them would do their ""school work"" from home but it would end up with them just sleeping and doing their work later. School may be difficult but that's why we have teacher to help you the staff and your parents they will always be there to help. Even the classes online that you do if you work from home have people to help you if you have any questions or if you just need help. Some people are visual learners like right infront of you that's is why i think kids shouldn't work from their homes. People are different some work better by themselves others work better in a group or with a partner that's is why working in school is the better idea.

I'm not saying saying it wouldn't benefit the kids who are doing their work online i'm just saying working in school is easier. I'm saying some students wouldn't benefit from working from home they would just sleep instead of work or they would just goof off instead of work. They're a lot of reasons is to why I don't think working from home or working online is a good idea. You never know who your going to meet online. Some kids don't have internet access so they wouldn't be to work online and when your at school you have all kinds of resources to help you.

My opinion in this is that working at school is better than working at home kids actually have a chance to get stuff done and at home kids would just sleep and not do their school work because well, they're at home.

E8F6D6EA06F1,"Should you agree to letting the school board add one and a half hour to the school days.

I disagree because it will make students less excited to come back to school the next day.

Students already have the work they have to do after school, adding more time to the schools will give less time for what the students have to do once they get home.

Students have the work in school that they get normally, but once the school board adds more time, the students will have the stress that they don't need.

The time that the school board adds will impact the students time, stress, and family management.

Students will come to school with less happiness.

Once the student gets to the school, they will have to do the same work with more time that they could have used to do their daily needs.

Students need the time with their love ones so that they could get work off of their minds.

Students will have to come back to school with one and a half less time to regain their thoughts and sleep for the next day.

Giving more time to schools will effect student's daily plans.

When the student goes home its for their time to get the work form the school done and to enjoy the time with their family.

Adding more time will effect the family time together, in replace that they will have to work on the time they wanted to talk with their family.

Students will argue to the school that it is unfair that they have to have more time in school, then they will be mad that they have to take one and a half hour away from the time they get out of school.

Adding more time to the school will put more stress on the students.

Students already have work on their mind when they are in school, adding more time will just add more work that leads to stress.

Once the student has stress they have to find a way to get it out but, they have to to work in the school and get work to do at home gives the student no time to get it out.

The stress that the student has can build up to make it turn to anger and frustration, the they can use it in means that they will regret in t he future.

Adding one and a half hour can put students in a tight spot.

Students will be upset to come to school, given what they have heard.

Students have to budget their time after school.

Work can give students stress that they don't need to have.

447221C3FA00,""" Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm""

Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". The thing is that if we going to do something good we have to failure anyways because for example, we are excited and we are going with enthusiasm to get a great results, but you never fail in the life and your enthusiasm is up. Success is failure one, two, trhee time. You are a human without loss enthusiasm is hard because some people have not enthusiasm to do the right things don't have power and are weak when herad something bad. I'm agree with him because to be a successfuly in the future your going to failre a lot of time. I have a friend that told me to get success in the life have to to fail and don't loss enthusiasm.

For me fail in my life is not something really bad, but just a little bit, you can keep getting good without problem. This is a important role because all people can think what they have to do about failure and how they can be preparate when their enthusiasm is up and later is down. Failure for me is not a mistake because by those mistake you learn and you can be better person. Some reason to be agree with him is that is true, you have to fail first and happens what the happens. Some people are not agree with this statement because they think that if you fail you going to be bad and your enthusiasm going down. Support ideas is not easy because this world have different kind of people with different kind of mind. Good examples to be success is do the best thing and if you fail don't say nothing to nobody, just do it and that sit. Some teenegers have the same problems everyday because when they are fail they think that something happen going to happen to them but they are their success to consist of going from failure.

In my conclusion I'm going to say that if you want to success in your life is necessary to fail because you learn from experience, you going to do everything right. For me in my future I'm not going to say nothing about failin g because I'm going to be calmly because I knew that with experience could be preparate for my problems. We have to be positive each day because you going to remember all the failure that you had in your past. I think fail is not bad for my life because it going to be a great experience.

44D395C2AD83,"The success can consists from failure to failure. Sometimes life is hard but never loss your enthusiasm. Not everything in life is going to be great as you planned. From your mistakes you learn something new or how can you succes in something that you fail. You always need to think positive doesn't matter if you fail and fail again but you going to have success in your life just believe that you can do it.

First, Many times in your life you will feel like you cannot do it anymore but never give up you have to keep goin until you reach your goal. Life can be hard and you can fail many times but never loss your faith. Your enthusiasm and your faith fot what you want to reach is going to be your better weapons in your success. Never loss your enthusiasm because, you can reach your success but nothing in life is always easy.

Second, Mistakes or failure are good in life because, thats is what teach you what you are doing wrong or what can you do for reach your success. I know many people that had been in many mistakes or failures, but they never give up and they had been patience to be successful in life. Sometimes people think if they fail one time, they cannot do it better next time or improve. Your failure, is not always bad as you think it is.

Third, People sometimes fail and they are close from reach their goals or they success, but they think that everything is done. If you believe in your self that you can do it and you have faith everything will be possible in your life. People think that an obstacle in your life will be an excuse to not keep going and reach your success. Sometimes you have to pass for many obstacles in your life because like I said life is not easy and every success need sacrifice.

Finally, In life to have success you have to work hard and sacrifice in order to reach your success. Failure is a big obstacle in your life because, it can make you to give up and not try or continue reaching your goal or success. Faith, bellieve in your self, pray for what you want and work hard these are some facst that can keep pushing you for your success. If you think you cannot do something that you never have done and you are scare to fail just try, doesn't matter if you do it wrong, but you are going to learn what you cannot do next time. Failure help you to pursuit your success and it's something that all humans we have to do because we are not perfects.

B067F0CBE15C,"Having students take courses during the summer to graduate in three years isn't a great idea. The reason why I think it isn't a great idea is, students might need more credit to graduate, some students have jobs during the summer and could feel stressed workng and going to school at the same time, and students like to take a year break off school.

First reason why I think it isn't a good idea is because, students might need more credit and need to take more classes. if they where to want to do it but didn't have enough credit they would have to double up there classes and doing that, can make them feel stresssed and pressured. Three years of high school isn't enough, in four years a student can join a club, play a sport and have regular classes and not feel over whelmed, and doing all that can make he/she look good when looking at what college to go to. But if a student wanted to do all that while having way to much classses could make them feel over whelmed.

Second reason why, students have jobs when they start high school. We all people like to have money in are pockets and students get there money by working during the summer. But how can a student have a job and go to school, it gives less time for the student to do his hobi which is working. In the summer a student wants to work to save up for a car or for college, it's the only time a student doesn't have to worry about school, they could just be focusing on saving up to go to a good college.

Last but not least, at the end of the school year students like to go ahead and go to college but some might want a break to make money or think about what they want to do or just want a break of school. Having a break gives you time to work full time somewhere and save up for something you need like, a car, a house, or money for colllege. It takes time for you to be successful in life which is why you should take things slow and not make yourself stressed and tired doing everything fast.

In conclusion, students who graduate in three years instead of four years, isn't a great idea. Students might need more credit to graduate, some might have jobs during the summer and if they where to take classes they could feel stressed, and some students like to take a year break from school and would want to be working making money for them to buy needs.

71A9098715EB,"Self-reliance is better then hoping someone makes the best decisions for you. This is because people need to follow there own instincts in life no one knows them like they do and what is best for them. Why would anyone want someone to make decisions for them, People will always want what is best for them so if people trust someone to pick a important life decision what if they pick something that will help them in there long run and not you.

My older brother 5 years ago was done with school and was planning his career he wanted to be a engineer but my mom and dad wanted him to be doctor; He made his own decision at the end and now lives his best life with a kid and wife. If he had chose to be a doctor he would be in school still and never meet his wife. This shows how important it is to trust your self even if no one agrees with you.

People will say that someone with more life experious will help others more then they can help them-self but they can make it so much further then others. Im not saying people should't have rolemodle just don't do something because someone else did it do it better then they ever could. My friend Generic_Name wanted to be a football player his whole life he was the best in our middle school team, but his mom and dad hated the idea they thought all football players end up hurt so he did't play in high school he did't like any other sports so he just went to school and went home. this left Generic_Name with not that many friends and he is sad and deperested today.

Making your own decisions all the time can be hard and at some point you may fail but if you keep trying you can make it big one day. There are many reasons to have someone make decisions for you it would be much less stressful and you would have less chance of failing, but everyone need to grow up at some point and do what is best for them, You can't live under someone your whole life at some point you will be on your own.

Those are the reasons I believe everyone should make there own decisions in the long run you will be 10 times the person if you trust your-self and do it your way. A person should never put there life in the hand of anyone but them-self. If someone stops talking to you because they dont like a decision you make and did't do what they said to do then they don't deserve to be in your life.",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.194071,3.180042,3.3059518,3.3099039,3.214467,3.102095,2.8411222,2.9996052,3.396516,3.0918436,2.6180925,2.7910528,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,461,15,0.4099783080260303,30.73333333333333,13,4,"{'10', 'mom', 'stressful', '5'}"
ABFEE879153D,"I believe that graduating high school in three years is the best option out there, the reason why i support this statement is because, i myself i'm graduating early the reason why i decided to this was because, i felt like i was too mature for highschool and i felt like i could do more things that highscool will limit me from doing. So many students see high school as an embergo, high school literally takes four years that alot of time, we could be out there gaining expreinces from being in the workforce and actually studying what we want to do, i also feel like highschool don't really focus on what the students actually want to do, we take classes that we won't even need after high school. Ok let look at it this way, when we take history classes in highschool are kids really going to remember what was George Washington favorite food? or when did the civil war began? yes i know it can be important for us to know our history but we should'nt be taking it for four years non-stop. For example let take a look at bill gates he was a smart kid in highschool, he also use to sneak to the college libary to do his work, because he felt like high school didn't offer him the amount of knowledge he needed so he decided to drop out of high school, and has you can see his on of the top billionairs in the World. What if there is a kid like that in highschool and he/she felt like highschool is not giving him the amount of knowledge he needed and he wants to graduate early but he can't do that because, were required to take four years of everything, and it's totally not fair. When i decided to graduate early, both my counselors and teachers where discouraging me that i should'nt do it, that colleges frown at those type of stuff and all that, but they did'nt know that i already made up my mind and i felt like i was ready to take on the world all by myself without the help of my parents. In conclusion i think three years of highschool should be encouraged alot in highschool, so kids can go out there and explore and live their dreams and actually study what they want to study. And they should'nt really make students take boring courses like history for four years of high shool non stop.

8C0D50387A60,"I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson because some people are comfortable where they are. It is alway good to go beyond your comfort zone and explore new thing. Without explore you will never know what you are cable of and you will never grow in life. It good to be satify where you are sometime, But when emergency come to need to explore to see who you truly are. He is also right because where Iam from lot of people are satify where they in life life.

I believe that the more you explore the more you grow. For example If Bill Gate was satify what he master with out exploring he would had never become a billionaire and he would never discovered the microsoft. And if

Barack Obama was satify with his education/knowledge he would never had became a Senator or the first Black

African American president of America and he was never going to be able to share is idea with America .So with out going beyond what you have mastered you will never know who you are and what you are cable of. Explore beyond what you have mastered and there will alway be a suprise , a new talent and a new growth in life. You will never discovered your worth/talent with out trying. Some people have that mind set that if they explore they will never make it. The more you explore the farther you go in life. Always pray to advanced to a new level not the level you have master. My mom alway tell me never be happy where you at step out of your comfort zone and explored.

So you will know who you truly are. For example if your boss is leave and they are looking for a new replacement for his/her position and you have knowledge/idea about the job, but you decided embrace where you are because you are scared to take a step in life. And you also have the mind set that they will turn you down. Some people in college are comfortable having there master degree but scared to get their doctorate degree because they feel that having their masters degree is the stopping point of their learning skills and they are not smart enough to get their doctorare degree. Some enviroment make you satify where you at.

Being happy with where you at is not a bad thing but the more you explored the more you grow in life. Never be happy with who you are alway fight for a better future on a better life. like Neil Armstrong Said "" a gaint leap for man kind"" some people need to take that gaint leap in their life.

7AAE019F70D6,"I disagree with the principal saying that all kids should at least join one extracurricum activity because kids have other things to do like homework,they might be already doing a activity and they'll get tired faster if the principal make them do a other activity, and it can contain stress if you don't get it right the first time.

For and foremost, I disagree with the principal saying that all kids should at least join one extracurricum activity because the student have homework to do and I know that i get a lot of homework maybe you do too i also know teachers give kids projects and if the principal makes them do a extra activity then they wont be able to have anytime to do their own things. Also studies have shown that making kids do a extra activity can contain a lot of stress and who wants to be stressing I know I don't, and it can also contain kids losing sleep do to the activities if they have homework and a activity to do it'll make the students lose sleep due to the activity and the brain needs a good hours of sleep for it to function well. This is why I say principals shoudn't make students join activies

Secondly, I disagree with the principal because the students will get way more tired faster and did you know that someone in Washington DC, fainted due to the principal making the student do a other activity and thats why the principals shouldn't make students join a other activity because it'll most likely make them get tired faster and what we want is to keep our kids healthy but we can't keep them healthy if the principal makes them join a activity.

Lastly,my last reason is stress, stress can come from a lot of things like work,school,friends,parents,children as you see stress comes from a lot and school stress is a big oe because we all know sometimes our grades go down and when we try to bring them up it gets really stressful and espcially if your pricipal is making you do a other activity that'll make even more stress and multiple studies have shown that a lot of the stress that kids get is from school and other activies. Those were all of my reason on why the principal shouldn't make students join a other activity espcially if they don't want too.

Overall,I disagree with the principal making students do a other actvity because of homework,losing sleep faster and last but not least is stress.

The more I study the better. Because I can have a future without a lot to worry about.

If I dont study I could end up having a poor job. If I have a poor job I will have to worry a lot more about how I'm going to pay this and that. So at the end its better to work hard when you the opportunity because it will pay off after in life.

After college I can have I can have better job opportunities. When you go to college you have more experience on what you want to work as. The more you know the more job opportunities you have.

When you look for a job they look at everything about you. When they see you went to college they will want you at their company. If you go to college you can study something you like and you know you will want to do in the future and then you will have two options.

I agree that home work club is good for are school. Do you like seeing your kids failing there classes your in luck I will tell the positive of having a homework club for your students how are failing and, I will tell you the native of having a homework club. If you are thinking about how munch it cost to have a homework club don't worry about how it cost you should only think about what happens if you do get a homework club.

I agree that homework club is good therefore all the students how go to home work club are getting good grades. It been proven by smart people that people how go to home work club get better grades then others students. The students can do homework in home work club and ask for help by the teacher.

If you are a teacher how is reading this what are your opinion about homework club. A teacher probably want what good for there students and they want to work after school with them.

ones I went to homework club I got help by the teacher and she help me to understand the subject that we were working on. Then the next day I went again to the homework club to study for the test that I have the next day.

I took the the test, when i got the test back I got a 100% on the test, ever since that day I went to homework club every day. The only bad thing you should worry is what if the students are only going there to talk with there friend after school.

I think that homework club should be add to every school so they can improve there school. When then other school how good your school is doing they are going to copy what your doing then the further of the students will be good so they can get good job and improve the world some way or another. The county will look at your shool and will give you more mony then you can improve the homework club and make your school better.

Therefore homework club is good for the students and I will give you a advice. You need to have a homework club for your school so they will have a opportunely to pass there classes.

The first reason I like volcanoes as an eductaion activity is because they are intresting. I've always wandered what caused a volcano to explode. Now I don't need to because I know now what causes them to erupt so voliently. Valcanoes are very fascinating to watch erupt when you see the magma flowing down. The magma can be so hot it can be like being hit with a ray from the sun. It's very awesome how the volcanoes are fromed and made. But as cool as volcanoes are they can still be pretty dangerous,because they could cause harm and erupt,cause chaos. sometimes volcanoes erupt at random times. Sometimes in villages or islands and in this case people don't have time to run. Because the magma flowing down is like an avalanche because it goes really fast and the people can't outrun the magma because it is to fast. There have been more volcanic eruptions that have killed people even children. Like pompei which was a huge volcanic eruptionthat killed a lot of people. After the eruption paremedics and police went back to discover the remains of people under huge rocks. Volcanoes are very intresting althougj they can be dangerous at times it's amazing how it looks when it erupts. Volcanoes are one of the greates things to study.

Next a volcano would make agreat science project. A volcano is a good science fair project. Because it's very amusing to see how the volcano erupts. When it erupts you can see the hot flowig magma as if people on a raft were going down. Volcanoes are a good science roject because it lets you know more about volcanoes and how thy come to form. Volcanoes are very rare to find here where I live at but there are still some outhere. That's a good science project not only because they explode but because you can even show the layers. Volcanoes have layers the top the middle and the bottom. The top is where the magma shoots out like a bullet from a rail gun. The middle is the less calm part and the bottom is where all the magam is. That is why I think a volcano is a good science project.

In conclusion an enjoyable educational activity is the science project of a volcano and i gave my two reasons why a volcano is a good educational activity. What is en enjoable educational activity for you?",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.353946,3.312253,3.4959302,3.462936,3.4132056,3.1628842,2.9397619,3.3576689,3.6414,3.331901,3.4079547,2.9708612,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,445,30,0.4584269662921348,14.833333333333334,22,11,"{'avalanche', 'magma', 'enjoyable', 'volcanic', 'eruptions', 'eruption', 'shoots', 'volcano', 'erupt', 'volcanoes', 'erupts'}"
AFF314E99BF2,"seeking multiple ideas can be good because...

they can give you good ideas and you can see that people think different.

you will be able to have multiple choices to pick from and make the right decision.

you can even meet new people while your at it and also they can help you see it in another perspective.

Are you having a hard time deciding something? if you are you should talk to other people and see what they think its good to see what others think because, they can help you decide and give you great ideas,for example i had a friend and she would help me decide all the time and she would give out great ideas and i would pick the right decision with her help.

Also they can give you ideas and you can decide what is the best one and you can make the right decision and see what is the best idea and you can make the right decision not just that but you can see how others think and they might think different from how you think for example if you think that chocolate is better and your friend thinks strawberry is better then you should give a try and see if you made the right decision by picking strawberry instead of chocolate or she might be wrong and chocolate is better then strawberry but you will never know in till you try it.

Perhaps they can help you see things in another perspective,also you can make new friends while your at it,but not just that you can share your ideas as well and they can see what you think and help you out if your stuck and they will tell you if your doing something wrong and help you out and see it in another perspective,you might think that going to the movies is better and your friend might think that staying at home and watching a movie is better and she starts telling you why its better and you end up staying home and watching a movie because the reason she gave you where good.

You should give new things a try to because you will never know if its a good idea or not just ask your friends on what you should do during the weekend and they will help you and you will be able to try new things and take new ideas from that and its also nice to talk to someone and share ideas it will keep your mind off things and you wont be as stressed because you will have someone helping you.

those are the reason i think you should be seeking ideas not just from one person but from more and i think you should give it a try and see how it goes and hopefully it goes well because it works for me so give it a try hopefully i helped you see things in another perspective.

B9DABCFD687D,"Being able to take online classes from home, is something that i would like for all schools to offer. Graduating high school is a need in this time and generation, for the reason being that most jobs ask for at least if you graduated high school. There is lots kids in school and not all have the time to go to school, some kids have to help there parents work for there not financially stable. I myself have gone through that where had gone to an alternative school so i could have more time to work in the day and come home to do some of my courses. Many people say education is the number one thing you should worried about and thats right, though some kids can't cause they have to help there family to provide in relation to paying some bills, put food on the table or picking up there siblings. providing school to be done at home will help the kids that have to go through all of this.

high school can be hard at times work is stressful some kids hate to having to get up early is hard for them so they miss out in some of class time. You keep missing some of class every day it can turn into hour's of class time that you missed, also can effect in the way you are learning having more time in your day to work can help you for there you are learning at your own paste, not the teachers. Some students that learn slow. takes time for them to learn one thing and by then the teacher is on the next unit there learning about. everyone has there own way that they learn better students that are fast learners wish that they can learn everything faster to get the class over with to go on to the next. those students can get classes online so they could do them at home to get the most credits they want this would also help them graduate faster.

Very few kids know what they want to work as for there career. Doing online classes can help these students graduate earlier to go the school they want to go to, or there career they want to lean on. This can help these students out in many ways. Going into a career path the earliest you can is a great thing you can get more time to learn and get good at to what you want to be doing like working become a master tech the younger you are the more experience you could have when you get older. The more chances you can get to become the best master tech at your location. Many students in high school learn in there own way also are smart in there own way graduating early can help students to become what they want to be the most.

90526CA48E47,"I strongly believe art classes such as drama, acting, and music should not be a requirement for students. I also strongly believe that students should have freedom to choose which elective him or her want's to take. A student that has the freedom to choose his or hers electives, he or she views the classes as more divers fun and interactive, then required art classes.

First of all most people believes that all students are required to take art class, music, and drama class. Most of all others think that students will actually cooperate to there fullest, and pass the class with higher letter grads. Like in an unrequited class most students will not actually take the art classes seriously, and fail with low letter grades. In comparison students with a required class will most likely take the class seriously knowing if they dont tighten up, and do what is asked the'll get low grades on multiple assignments like projects, class projects, and event tests. An nonparticipating students score will drop significantly. Which in fact they are wrong student shouldnt have to take the art classes to begin with.

In my true opinion student should have the chance to express his or her true feelings, and reach a main goal in life. People arent going to tell use students what career paths to fallow we simply choose our own paths. Really in fact art classes should be an elective instead of it having to be required. Art classes are fun I my self take art by choose and enjoy ever single part of it. Again arts should not be a requirement for students it is unethical, and unheard of as far as i know.

Music, drama, and art class are three amazing electives, and forever will be electives. what sense is it to make an art class a requirement to pass? No sense in my opinion art allows us students to express out inner happiness, deepest emotions, and embrace them. However, at the end of the day art classes should be and always stay an elective. What use will it be to us students in the real world? No use at all, unless a student wants to fallow a career path in art.

All the more reasons why I know art classes such as drama, acting, and music classes should not be a requirement for students. Electives are much more divers, fun, and interactive. Also students should have the freedom to choose his or her electives. There is no sense in making an art class a requiermnet for use students. Most students are not fallowing a type of caree in art, and will not be of much use to us in the future.

First, when having a positive attitude you think more. It opens up your creativity makes you a critical and creative thinker. It helps you think about positive things and not negative things. When your at a difficult moment and you have a positive attitude it motivates you to keep going and not to give up. Even during a difficult time if you were to have a positive mindset It would help you In the future by giving you confence to get out of that position you were In. Even going through a difficult moment is a good thing because it will help you during the long run because your getting a taste of the how life actually goes. Next time your In a difficult moment try to have a positive attitude it will help you through those hard times and it will motivate you not to give up.

Secondly, when I was in 7th grade my friend was taking a very important test. The test was about 35 questions and I remember he was worried that he wasn't going to pass it. He started to tell me ''what happens if I don't pass it my parent's are going to get so mad at me''. He also told me ''I'm not going to pass this test''. What I told him was ''don't worry about it do your best and you got this just have a positive attitude''. Then I went to the bathroom and once I came back I saw him jumping around and happy. Once I got inside the classroom I said ''what happened I said'' he said ''I passed the test''. I got so happy that just by having a positive attitude great things can happen to you.

Thirdly, It doesn't matter where you are weather your in a airplane or even in Mexico having a great attitude can change so much. It can even change you and your life. I once said to myself having a great a positive attitude means having a great day. When your at a difficult moment in your life or just anytime. You feel stuck of sad and you feel like you want to give up be positive and say to your self you got this I can do it. One benefit of having great attitude is it motivates you to be successful and to not give up.

So going to park can be enjoyed in different ways, theres a chance you might just make a new friend.

Although some students will don't want graduate early because they are not ready to being a university life or alone life, nevertheless for others students is a good choice being her life or overtake her life, for example they have more opportunities for study a long profession like Doctor, students will have more time to doing think they like as to travel, and if they want can make a family.

Students make a complied because they want to study a long profession and they don't have some many time to doing all thing they want. The students said normally the people finish high school between the 17 or 18 and they know are young, but some time they need a break before to enter the college and if one student want to study a long profession he or she don't have so many time to take a break and study a profession like a doctor than is during like

5 or 6 years. This significant than student need more time to doing one thing fun before to enter the college. Additionally in the future may be they need another break after the finish college I opportunity the young people like travel too much and know others countries, they own country, they want watch new things, they know different s people, different language, different accent or pass free time with her family, friend, or play any sports. This is important because although they have time when they graduate at 18 or 19. Maybe if they finish high school when they have 16 have more time to graduate the college early and doing so many thing they like to do.

Another students want finish early high school to do others things so different like make a family and find a good job they like so much. So many adolescences think in money since so young , they need money, money for buy some material thing like a car, an apartment, so many clothes so expensive. This is important because the adolescences think finish most early high school is like they said "" if I graduate the high school a the 16 then a began to work like than i will have 21 i have all the thing I need for begin an alone life, then will want to married get a big family.

High school students are graduating in three years because open more opportunity of life ,knowing the new world of college works,beneficial being a young student .

first,

open more opportunity. for example the journal life of my older brother Generic_Name it is easy. He finish high school early in three years, bring it to him advantages to be successfully life for get a job a early age, he also got offers for different colleges ,the Harvard University send to him a letter for being a youngest students to finishing the school early, the day , I remember exactly we were sitting on the table eating the breakfast, my brother was brought a letter in his hand and crying at the same time, we did not realize, the most grateful new getting a free scholarship to attend at Harvard University so my brother Generic_Name was in shock. This explain getting early high school diploma bring a lot of opportunities.

second, knowing the new world of college. for example. Generic_Name my oldest brother is attending the most prestigious university of the world Harvard university. He talked to me a few details about the roll day at university, he says the University its not hard, to being at early student attending a university with just three years of finish high school. He, say the university feels other home with news experiences to discover it. This explain University with early graduation in school it's not a problem.

Third, beneficial being a young student graduated from high school. For example my dear brother Generic_Name. I'm super proud of him to taking major responsibilities in young age, he just took three years of high school and get done it. he called to my mom the day, when he notice the program to graduated early in school , my beautiful mom told him that is a good way to set up early his future and would be able to star a enrollment in university. The university believe students must be a genious to finishing high school early, University offer extra credits for being a young student. This explain young students graduated early are considered as smart person.

Three years of high school to achieve it the most dreaming diploma.

High school in three years, people belief students enough mature or full of knoledge to throught a real life but Graduating in three years of high school brought us brilliants benefits for the future.

85F4C57672EA,"""Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home""? I do not believe that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. I believe the students can get distracted so easily at home. For example, you start watching a movie; when you were supposed to your homework. That would affect your grade because you didn't do it on time. Another, example is when your mom tell you to buy something and then you forgot what were you doing. In addition, time is another reason why is not beneficial taking classes from home.

Time is one of the consequences attend to classes online is not beneficial because unexpected things can happen. You can't control time. For example, someone in your family die or they have a car crash or even work schedule. Those examples can affect you by reducing the time and material you were to work on. That's why you can't predict what is unexpected. Unexpected times take away your energy, concentration and comprehension on what your studying. Another, reason why classes from home isn't good.

Energy keep you awake. Being concentrate shows interest on what you doing and comprehension is how much you understand. If you're sleepy you cannot do any of that. However, I want to focus more in the comprehension part. Never ever compare a teacher vs a computer. For example, you didn't understand the new unit because is confusing, you can always put your hand up and ask the teacher. The teacher will explain at their best for you to comprehend. On the contrary, you can't do it because you're at home and nobody can explain the material you don't understand.

Some students agree they can benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they can do it later, if they miss something on class. Also, they can study anywhere they can have access to it. That reject to be in certain place. You're free to study and work without any restrain. All you need is to manage your time.

You be able to kill two birds on the same shot.

To conclude, students will realize that a teacher is way better than a computer. The teachers study the materials on what they gonna teach and they graduate from college, gain a diploma of what they teaching you. They have the proof and I believe they are doing the right choices about giving you materials for you on the future. That's why i would never change them for one computer at home.

It is well informed that people can be complicated but nobody will said the life will be easy all the time. I think people should start making their own decision because, they can learn about life, have a better understanding on how life works and how to value their-self and be efficient person on their own.

However, there is a big chance that people can tell you how you really should live your life, you have to experienced it in persons there will be a day when you are going to fall or something can happen you are not aware on how life can be so hard and difficult in times. Also mistakes are allow nobody is perfect life will surprise you anytime without you notice it you got to be ready to face it not matter how easy or hard it could be. When you make your owns decision you will be capable of making the right decision for yourself.

Meanwhile, it is hard to understand life sometimes but is part of our daily life and you have to understand how it really works so the way you do not stress out for a simple thing, life gives you challenges that only you as the only responsible of yourself have to face it and all will depends how you take things it will be a result of it. As we grow life will make us stronger or weak it all depends but best choice of making the right thing is that you should be aware that anything can happen without given you a hint it will hit you on the right time or not on the best time you wanted it. Anything that will hurt you will make you strong and that's how you know that your are living life.

Lastly, people might not notice it but if we do not love ourselves nobody will do it, people do have to depend on some else to be happy it's all about you. In addition anything you do will not make others happy you have to learn to do everything on your own because that more efficient you are the more good things in life you will make. Be your own and value every single thing that is around, but remember nothing is easy life can surprise you anytime.

F9DDE725DB74,"To begin with, it is good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college or the work force one year early?. In point of view, it is good idea because when students finish their high school in three years, they also can work, and save money to enter college. So it's good for students graduate in three years and obtain their diploma, and start to apply in some college. Also, students can find better jobs with their diploma.

First, it is good idea for students graduate and obtain their diploma because some students need the diploma to enter college. For example, my friend Generic_Name needed her diploma and start to apply in summer to enter at the

Hampton University. Furthermore, students who's want to achieve their diploma in three yaers, they have to work hard. But some students wants to achieve their goals without make any kind of effort.

Second, students can find better jobs with their diploma because if you don't have any diploma you cannot work in a proffessional job where people pay more. For example, my sister Generic_Name have to work after she graduate from from high school, but she need a good job to save money to enter one year later at college and pay her first semester. Instead, some students have to work because they don't have any type of help from their families.

If students have to work is because they want to enter college.

Third, some students cannot finish their high becuase they have to work for maintain themself. For example, my cousin Generic_Name cannot finish his studies because he have to work at 3:00 pm to 10:00 pm so he don't have time to his asignments of high school. Some students can't graduate not because they don't want to, cause they have to pay bills from their homes. Also, they don't have a better job to pay their studies from college and its harder to them to obtain the diploma from high school.

In conclusion, it is good idea for students finish their high school in three years and enter to college. So it's good for students graduate in three years and obtain their diploma. So students can find better jobs with their diploma and pay their studies from college. But, students can't graduate not because they don't want to, cause they have to work and pay bills from their homes. Also, when students have a positive main they can achieve whethever they want, it doesn't matter the situation that you live you can finish your high school and enter college if you work hard.

6C045F130B28,"Technology in today's life is, so advance that it has both positive and negative impact on people's life. According to me, I think that technology has change people's style of living. Technology at some point slow downs the physical growth or development of our body and it stops us from learning new things, But on the other hand it helps us to complete many task and save time. Modern technology has negative impact on peoples life.

People can check out books, shop, and play games without moving form place and talking to anyone. This leads to no physical activity, which slow downs physical development of our body. In fact, there was a survey taken few days ago and it states that more then 45% of middle schoolers in U.S.A has to take some kind of vitamin medicine as the dont eat their lunch properly because they watch t. v or phone while taking lunch, 38% middle schoolers have glasses because of sitting in front of TV or using phone all the time, and more than 46% students are overweight or underweight as they don't do much physical activities.

Secondly, technology stops us from learning new things. Technology helps people to complete new task in every day life, and then we get use to taking help from technology instead of trying it our self or learning it we get a habit of letting technology do our work. For example, if our mom not stopped us form spoon feeding then we would take it for granted and never learn how to eat our self.

But, On the other hand technology helps us to complete many task and save time. Technology helps us from not being delayed, it complete task 50% more faster than us, and helps us to save 25% of more time. For example, Our group got an assignment to do on Monday and the deadline to submit it was on Friday, So if i would read books to find some info, it would take me at least 2 weeks to complete that assignment, but thanks to modern technology,I was able to finish it in 3 days.

At last, I would like conclude that technology plays a major role in our day to day life. It has both type of impact negative and positive and it impact's on our life, but the main thing is ""how and when we use it"". Technology changes lifestyle of people and if we use it more it slow downs our physical growth and stop us from learning new thing, on the other it also completes our task easily and faster that us. So less use of technology gives us positive effects and more use of it gives us negative effects.

B03AB7243AE5,"Millions of kids graduated last year when taking the program for early graduation, this program helps student to only take three years in high school. Most of the parents, students, and the teachers like to see students graduate early in high school, and this programs are mostly in the U.S.A. Student who graduated early will have a lot of opportunity to finish school and have a better life, most summer school lesson can also help students to take less classes at school. It is a good idea for student to take only three classes in high school in order to graduate and go to college, back those days my mom use to tell me a story, about the opportunities we have in we that most people don't really care about. She used to tell me a story about her in high school, how hard it is to graduate, most people can take five to six years in order to graduate and go to college. And most people did- en make it to college, cause they don't have the money to pay and it really hard to find a job in Africa. Student drop out of school just because they don't have the opportunity we have right now to graduate in high school. Most people will say it like this, ""Genius without education is like silver and mine"". People are brave, strong, smart, last learning, and well educated but they just don't use it and decided to let it go. This mostly happened to people who have the opportunity to do the right things but decided to let it go, and my gran mother use to tell me a story. If you ready to help yourself, God will be ready to help you, if you not trying to help yourself, God will not going to help you. All this opportunity we have are all helpful in many ways, taking three years in high school is very help full for most of the students, reasons why graduation early in high school is better than waiting for four years are.

first reason, the three years of high school helps student to graduate early and move on to the next level, helps student to finish school early and have a better life.

Second reason, helps students learn faster and makes it easier for college, it also helps student to take less classes in high school.

the last but not the least, summer school programs can help students understand better and easier than normal classes because, less distraction from other students and having opportunities to ask questions you don't understand.

Student must take this programs very security, so you will be able to graduate early in high school or a small leak can sink a great ship.

3A2DBB1E0556,"I believe that my skill is I can speak another language,Korean, fluently. Speaking another language is not effortless but the effort give pleasure that I can help other people. It is tired and hard to help other people, but assist make people glad. My ability is I can speak Korean, acquired Korean by reading the books, can use my skill usefully by teaching Korean to Korean - American and communicate and help Korean.

I developed my Korean skill by reading books often. I read a Korean book at least in a week. Mostly, it was hard to understand and I had to find the words meaning in every single time. However, I could improve my writing skills,

vocabulary skill and I could speak Korean and write logically. For example, I took World Language Exam last year, I could use the words that I saw when I was reading a book. Also, I could make my writing clearly, organize and I understood prompt very well. In addition, my parents read Korean books to me and my brother. That made me to understand and speak in Korean fluently.

I can use Korean skill very usefully by teaching Korean to Korean- American. Usually, people who were born in America but their families are Korean, and they don't know how to write, speak and write in Korean. For example, I go to the church every Saturday and help to teach Korean to the teenagers or children. It is hard but they can learn Korean from Korean school and communicate with families. For example, they become teenagers, and they can speak only English and their parents can speak only Korean. They will not able to communicate each other. They will become farther. Nevertheless, teenagers can ignore their parents that they cannot speak English.

Communicate with Korean can be useful because some Korean are immigrated to America with not enough English skills. They need help with bills, housing and information of America. If you go any stores or community center, they are having difficult because they can't speak English so they cannot understand what the owner is trying to say. If you can speak Korean, you can help them. For example, I was student ambassador which is help new students to touring the school and help them with the schedule. The new student came to our school and she was Korean and she cannot speak English. I introduce the school, and class schedule in Korean to her so she can understand about school system.

There are lots of advantages if you speak another languages. You can acquire Korean by reading books that help to improve your writing, reading, vocabulary skills. Also,teaching Korean to children or teenagers and can communicate with Korean can help people.

2CDDE76979DD,"I believe that working with a group is better than working independently. I say that because work gets done faster with more people than just one person. Also More ideas would be brought up because other people in your group have different experiences. Another reason is People can get different parts in the work so it doesnt all depend on one person to do everything.

My first reason why working with a group is better than working independently, because work gets done faster and is easier with more then one person. For example lets say i have a group project with 3 other people, I would split it into 4 different parts so one person doesnt have to do the whole project by him/herself. Another example is if you get stuck on some part while your working, your group can help you do it instead of asking other people that are not even doing the same thing as you. Also its easier because lets say Ur sick and you cant get your work finished, your group mates can most likely finish it for you so you wont get stressed out.

My second reason why working with a group is better than working independently is you get different ideas and experiences from different people. For example if you had a essay about living in England, theres a good chance one of your group mates knows something about it or has experienced it by living in England. Another example is everybody thinks differently, so another person might have a idea that you never thought of or it could be the other way around. Also when you have more then one brain working on the same work then ideas keep coming up from each other like its a chain of some sort and you wont get stuck on anything.

My final reason about why working with a group is better than working alone is your future. If you only work independently that means you arent really cooperative with other people or have much experience talking to others, which could effect what sort of job you get in the future. For example if you get a job as a PC support you have to talk to other people and ask whats going on with Ur device, which means cooperating with some random people and you need skills for that. Also if your a construction worker you need to work together to build a structure of some sort, so you would need communication skills for that therefore you really cant improve that if you work independently all the time.

Some people might say working independently is better than working with a group while others might disagree because work gets done faster with more people, everybody has a different experience and knowledge about stuff and its better for Ur future because you have to cooperate with other people and you need skills to do that.

"" Determine never to be idle"" It is not good when you are not doing much work. Don't be un idle.

I support my idea with several reasons.

First of all,

I personally agreed with the Thomas Jefferson wrote. If you use your time properly,time is very important in your life you will be productive day use your time. For example I must be weak up in the morning do my exercise every day. I will be healthy It is very important when you have a good healthy. After that you will be managing your time for the hole day by firshing your time. Then I go on time my school. Because to have a good skill is very important. ""knowledge is a power"" I will get my a good education. Also, I go to my job and make my money in the mean time. For this reasons when use your time that will be a good productive day makes you happy. I heat to be seat and watching TV all day and play game.

Second, I am very happy for making some one happier or helping.

Because on my extra time I always go to the library and working as a voluntary helper for some people need help. Also, what ever i have information I shard with people and give a good information then make them happier.

In addition, I always go with the alimentary school when they have school trip.

Helping for the teacher. Especially, working with the kids it is fun and having a good time when i help the kids it make me happy.

Third, you will be a successful and accomplish your life. When you work hard you will be have a good life for the rest of your life. At the same time all your family have a good life. In addition, Life is short you need to be work hard don't be rune slowly it is good to be not idle. The more you work the more get success.

Eventhough, some times have a difficult time never give up you have to be strong and continue do some thing. Also, when you have a bud habite avoid as soon as a possible to be a successful person.

Incounuclsion, It was wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing the right way.

It is not good running slowly or not doing much work.

you should be work hard and discipline for every thing. That's way I agree with the wonderful Idea ' Thomas Jefferson wrote'

5985EA6F171A,"I think is a good idea that the students start thinking about what they want to study in the college, what they want to be in the life, and they start preparing for the future in the high school. It is a good idea because they can start working when they are really young, It is a good idea too because they can make money when they are young, It is a good idea because they can buy they own things with their own money, like a house, a car, or whatever they want, and they can get graduate really young and that is the way to prepare you for something.

For example you can stop living with your family you can be indepent, nobody can tell you anything you can rent your own room just for you and you can have your own space, another example is that you are young maybe you make a wrong decision in the career that you choose but the good option is that you are young you already did the high school maybe you already work so you have money you can start another career more important something that these time you already liked because you are more older you know more about what you really want. Also in the work that you have you can study a little bit more and you can scale to another position too much better when you are young you're body don't feel so tired when you work because you have more energy, but when you are more older your body start feel tired, you start loose energy the sickness come your body hurt you have to go more to the doctor, so when you are young you can work more for you retirement.

In conclusion is a good idea that the students start commit a career at a young age because that are going to help them to be someone in the life, also that are gonna help them to be an important person. But the more important is that you are going to work in what do you love to do. The benefit of start preparing for a career since the high school is that you are going to be a young with a lot experience, also that help to the young students stop thinking on bad things, like cigar, tobacco, alcohol etc. Also help them keep their mind busy and to be in high school and not in the streets with bad friends that help them to keep a educational way. And is something that they are going to use in the life and is something that is good, what we need now is a societies based on education because that is a good thing because the education come with a lot of opportunities and with that opportunities the students can lear a lot, the learning is the best thing on the world.",2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.919921,2.7407956,3.0381017,2.8762581,2.6392395,2.852715,3.401386,2.7331777,2.9062173,3.110071,2.3454409,3.0542715,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,492,9,0.3211382113821138,54.66666666666666,7,0,set()

AFC600D922F6,"I agree because being yourself is very hard sometimes and feel a lonely. Today is in the world nobody like to be all by themselves but some people like to be themselves. If you being yourself you can able to do more work because nothing else to do and feel like board so let study something, work hard. How about your fun time go out with someone, you can't be work hard all the time because that is not a good experience. So I do sometime fun myself and be yourself It's doesn't means you can do any a good stuff. You can do something what is make you feel a happy all your life. don't feel strange yourself and being strong.

First, I like be myself sometime because that make me bring my own idea and also help me figure our myself. What is a good thing or what is a bad thing for me. That make me strong because I using my own bring and think twice myself before I do something. My first year was be American be myself without Family, I feel very sad, and I sad to myself I never want to be myself my life again. I want to go back where are I am came From, I don't want to be in American anymore because know language very important for me that time. I don't understand any English that time and I don't have any Friends. I still remember how hard the was being yourself and I never knew be yourself Will be that hard, Now I know.

Second, after couple years I make my own choose I wan to be myself but no more sadness. So what I did was no looked what other people do and people I ignore with Friends they're all together or family because that make me sad. I could't told you how bad that feel was for me and I relax everything will be fine, I take deep bread. Now I don't worry about be myself anymore because now I know that wasn't that bad after you use to and also, infect that make me a little bit more independent.

Third, Now I responsibility everything myself and be myself that make me diff rant. My last year was raft because my faster Family said to me you have to learn do stuff by yourself.

F1A5FE43ADD0,"Even though other believe working alone is easier and better. I

strongly believe student do benefit from working in a group. Working in a group has it's advantages, and I feel it's a better choice. When work work in a group you can see different ideas,learn to work with other and also you can met new people.

When you work with other people you can see the different ideas also you can learn know things. You can see the same problem in different ways but as a group you try to find the best way to solve them. For example let's say you have to do a project for a class, and you have to do it in a group. As a group you can share you Knowledge of what you know about the topic and share them with you group . Also you can share you ideas with your group,and see if they like it or maybe they can add something more to your idea to make it a better one . You can see who you have in common with them also you can see the differences you have with you group members .

Working as a group can really have a good advantages. If it is a really big project you dint have to do it alone. Also you can split work and everyone can get a small portion of the project. You can also see people creativity. In a group every one is good in something, so lets say if there is some who is really good at drawing and some one really good in writing then the project can look really nice and the penmanship will look great. You can get it done half as fast with every one in the group does what they have to do and work as a team .

When you work in a group you can met new people. Maybe you change schools. You do not know any one at your new school. When you work in a group, you can meet new people and make friends. It also work if you are shy because in a group you have to communicate with others to get the work done, or you are just a born leader you can help other how to start the project together or tell people how to do thing because they do not know what to do first. Also it works so you can get out your confer zone and try new things. For example you really like to draw but you do not know how to draw really good maybe some one from your group knows how and they can teach you .

As a conclusion I think student do benefit when they are in group. Because not only they can share there different ideas. You learn how to work as a team. You can met new people, and make new friends.

The president Thomas Jefferson wrote ""it is wonderful how much may be done if we are doing."" what these means is if your always work, even for society or for your self. Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something,or does inactivity also serve a purpose?. Some says inactivity serve a purpose because is a rest to get strong and keep working. Although some say always doing something is better because if you always work hard you get your goals and you are productive to the society.

Millions of people wake up every morning to work give all of them and make their best doing work, but what about people who don't work. Even if you can't find a job you can rapport to the society or your growth as a person. you can do social work or help people, you have to be an active person. Is important to say everybody needs to rest, but if you get to much rest you won't be able to reach your dreams and goals.

Do something always is good if your doing good things, work hard and passionate for what your do every person who work is for something. they want to reach goals dreams some of them got to pay to much thing or some of them just love work and make money or support your family. everybody works for something and that makes them work. My mom always tell me if you want something go for it, make it happen all of us needs a good future a better future, thats why you always have to do something. It is the reason why is better doing something than nothing.

Lets talk about the society view. In society you have to do something even if you have a dream or not because you gotta eat, where to live, pay bills, taxes and any needs that you have to cover so you have to have a job. And not just a job you can do other things to always do something like i said before help people that makes you growth as a person, and even tho is free or they pay you if you love what your do, or love to do a productive human for the society you will consider do good things.

Do something is important in the humanity because that makes these world work and grow up. dreams and goals make people do what their do. think about if you are a productive person or you does inactivity may be changes your mind. in conclusion the president Thomas Jefferson give us these quote to think about what do we do or what we should do on our life. Is good to take a break, but don't forget you have goals an dreams that you have to make them reality.

People who are indecisive, tend to seek for advice, and with input from multiple people, they can go with the majority of what people say. Out of the many opinions someone could receive, one may influence them more than the others and help them make a decision they are positive on. People sometimes may be unsure of something, so they seek for multiple opinions and those opinions could give that person that assurance they need to establish a finalized decision. Multiple opinions increases a greater chance to help a person make a better choice.

People who are indecisive could overthink and they may make a choice that they are unsure about. Asking multiple people for opinions could give them a better understanding on what choice to make. If you need advice on a deciding what to do, like choosing what pair of shoes you want to wear, you could always make an easy decision and go with the majority of what people favor most. Indecisiveness can lead a person to making an unsure decision causing them to later regret what they did, so you can save yourself from the trouble of that, and seek for multiple opinions to help you carefully decide.

When asking multiple people for advice, you can receive all sorts of different answers. Out of all the answers you get, there may be some that are of no help whatsoever, but there also could be one that could influence you heavily and be great of help. It possibly could open up a new window of thoughts that you'd never would have. That one opinion could give you a better understanding and help you make a decision that you are really sure of.

You're now stuck on making a tough decision, and you have a decision in the back of your mind already made up, but you're not sure if you should make the call. You ask someone for advice on what to do, but it just isn't enough to convince you to do it. Seeking multiple opinions could give you the assurance you need. There could one or more opinions that could help you make that final decision about something you are wavering on.

There are many reasons why seeking multiple opinions can help you to make a better choice. It will help those out who are indecisive and give them an easy decision to make. Out of all the advice you receive, there may be one that'll help make things clear and help make it easier for you to decide.

87694700310E,"First impressions is always something that i pay attention to when meeting a person for the first time. I will always agree with the fact that first impressions are almost impossible to change. Why? imagine meeting a person and the only thing you think about when they cross your mind is the way they first greet you or the way that they introduced themselves to you.

For instance, in my opinion, i feel that people will always put on a different character for their ""first impression"". For example, calling a job for a interview is something you'd want to change your normal character into a more formal and nice responsible person. You can never change your very first thought of someone, it may change later but not the first second of your conversation. Another example could be is getting someone introduced to you from a friend. On the other hand, there's always an ""i wonder"" question in my mind about everyone, because it's totally normal. When meeting someone new there is many of ways people act towards you. They may act shy and make you feel awkward, or they may act friendly and make you feel welcome. So, with that saying, you can never change the way you first think of someone, first impressions will always be a permanent statement that your brain can't erase.

Accordingly, if you do have the abilities, you can always tell what type of person they are. With just one impression someone can teach you about themselves a bit, theres no doubt in that. It's fun of how our brains permanently label people from our first impression until it is changed to something else. For example, imagine seeing some person that is always quiet, always seems like their mad or doesn't want to be at the function. What first impression would you get from that person? I would honestly not even bother to talk to them, they could say anything mean to me, But with first impressions changing overtime, you never know once that person starts talking they wont stop smiling or talking. You never know truly about something until you experiment it.

In conclusion, the first day of school where you have to introduce yourself, or being at public place and someone asks you for something in a nice way, what do you think about that person? From first impressions, after seeing that person for the second time you would always go back and think about how the first time went. While getting to know them that same thought changes about them because now you truly know who they are. The first times will always be different than the regular times. I will always agree that it is impossible for first impressions to change because of our natural human traits.

Technology made our lives more easier than before. Although we spend most of the time using technology rather than doing physical activities,because we can read books,watch movies, play games,or shop online,it also helps in our education, and we can stay in touch with others.

Technology helps us to stay in touch with our friends and family. Through social media,we can share our daily routines,share our pictures or we can make new friends. People on social media are so excited to share their stories with others. We can learn some lessons by knowing each others experience. By sharing our lives personal experience maybe those inspires to other and they could make their lives better.

Nowadays technology have a big hand in education. Schools,Colleges,and University prefer laptops or computers more rather than using books or papers. Through technology students can easily access to their assignments or missing work. Students can take help from internet in their assignments and can easily submit their assignments to teachers online. Teachers can also access to other teachers resources to help them in teaching.

Most of the people use technology for entertainment to watch movies,play games and read books in free time. Nowadays we can play games with our friends even though they lives in other country. For entertainment we can record ourselves and upload that online as a daily v log and this is not just entertainment we can earn money through technology. We can also shop online or we can also sell products online and make money. Most of the people who are busy in their lives they prefer to shop online not going to market and search for their desire products.

We spend our most of the time using technology,for example using social media,playing games,or watching movies that leads us to get lazy,sleepy,and sometimes it feels sick. Technology is addicting we cant spend our day without using technology because technology is playing a big role in our lives. It brings so much to our lives for example entertainment, helping hand in education,and more.

3E6C6F1FE64D,"Imagine going to school and it's your first day back from summer vacation and you walk into class with a weird impression that some teachers want to change because they know you can change the way you act or talk to other people. I think first impressions can be change because there are people that struggle to show how they feel so they have this mean impression towards people the cause of it might be parents divorce a lot and a family member passing. Some resources say that 50 percent of the population tend to give students or parents an impression that is either showing how they feel towards something.

Firstly, changing an impression might be a challenge for some people but they said its impossible to change in my reasoning I think it's possible to change someones first impression. You really can't give someone an impression if you don't know anything about them or if you don't know them. You can't always say ""oh their so mean"" until they know your background. The reason I say that is because most of the time it's true most people would give an impression towards new students at school, but they don't know anything about the person. In reality, I disagree with first impressions are almost impossible to change because you can change that impression that people tend to have on there face.

Secondly, there are other ways you can show your impressions if you don't want to show them. The first one is that you need to try to befriend them and make a conversation you never know you and that person might have a lot in common that you just didn't know to begin with. Your impression doesn't judge but it's the way you show it because sometimes it led to making new friends, having good grades, and making your own decisions in life sometimes.

Thirdly, I think impressions can change because nobody said anything about ""anything isn't impossible "" but a lot of stuff is possible if you believe there is. My reasoning to this prompt is that if you don't try hard enough to change the impression you have on your face then how can you make friends or how can you ignore what people are saying about you . Everyone can change especially their impressions you just keep trying and get to know the person.

In conclusion, I think first impressions can be change if you act right towards people and how you treat others with your impression. Nothing is impossible if your don't try to change it or if you don't try to make a way to get people to be on the same level as you in the end. So I totally disagree with this prompt for saying that first impressions are almost impossible to change.

The idea here will be to study the pros and cons with ralation to the particular indvidual and not to the group of which she is a part. First we will try to understand the dynamics of a group vis a vis individual, then understand the various issues involved in working as a part of the group. We would also see as to how those issuse will be influencing the person, be it in the positive side or being a hindrance.

Remamber last time when you had to do your project. You must have contemplated doing it by many ways. But some thing that comes to mind very in the beginning is either individually or in a group. Every body by facto knows what it is to be individual and perform a task individually, as she is the only person who is doing the task. But what is group and how it is formed and what are the dynamics involved in it.

So what is a group, we may dedine it as a collection of several people who come togethor to do a particular task or goal. And the group form, their structure and process and also deals with how it is functioning. This aspect of group dynamics is relevant in formal and informal groups of all types. In any organisational entity groups are very common entity and hence their study and group dynamics is an important area in the study of oranisational behaviour.

Being with group dynamics let us see what exactly it is about, it basically deals with why and how groups are formed and developed. In order to explain the same many theories have been proposed.

While group work has a host of merits, it also has its flip sids. Firstly, individual students usually lack the power to control the task as compared to when the work is assigned to one person for completion. Additionally, some group members tend to dominate in terms of contributions while othors may become dormant. In this case, the group may achieve its goal but limit other students. Work well together can achieve much more than indvividuals working on their own. A broader range of skills can be applied to practical activities and sharing and discussing ideas can play a pivotal role in deepening your understanding of a particual subject area.

Laws; the consumption of drugs and alcohol, to carry of guns, and to drive; the consumption of drugs is unlawful in too many states and you need a permission that you can buy it and the alcohol is legal but you need to be 21 years old or more to buy it, to carry of guns; is legal but is same to drugs and alcohol you need a permission to buy one and be older, and to drive to get a license need to be 16 or older that its up to you, but if you decided to get your license when you are 16 years old, you have to drive with someone also as copilot; the copilot need be more older than you, you need to do this because they want be sure you have the experience to drive alone.

Work; when you have a job you have rules that you need to follow as a schedule, duties; you have a specific schedule that tell you when you have to come to the work and when you have go to home this help to your job keep everything organize to the employers because if the employers come to the work whenever they want to, can this affect the company, like if you are an accountant and the company needs you in the morning but how you make your own decision to do not go in the morning you go in the afternoon, so as you skip your specific schedule the company have a problem with the accounts and its your fault for not follow the schedule, duties well you have specific duties for you by your skills, so that mean you can not make a decision do something also because you can be fire.

Society; well you do not have the decision to do every thing you want outside, like you can not to burn a library because you had the idea brilliant to do it, you can not kick or hit to everyone to see outside just because you have a idea make laugh your friends, and you can not into a private property to get a flower that you see and liked , you can not make that decision in your life

In conclusion, we can not let the people make their own decisions, I am not saying that people can not have rights to do or be something, I am saying that people can not do everything they want, they need guidance from experts and authorities to help them more to the minors they do not have the conscience to know what is right or no.",3.0,2.0,3.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.7873056,2.6188743,2.987321,2.7555575,2.5421948,2.7339814,3.155526,2.6716647,3.735644,3.470126,3.1985552,2.9299767,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.5,2.0,498,4,0.3353413654618474,124.5,1,5,"{'accountant', '16', 'copilot', '21', 'unlawful'}"
ACB4771E367E,"Imagine living an outgoing life or a lazy life. It's like talking about a traveler and a video game addict. In my opinion I think we do accomplish more if we are always doing something because when you are out doing something you gain experience, also when your out doing something you tend to meet new people, even though some would argue that living a inactivity life also serves a purpose because inactivity allows you to live a life closer with your family.

First when your out doing something you gain experience. In my opinion when your constantly out you gain social experience. For example you wont be as shy to speak to others, and you wont be awkward when socializing. Also, when your out you are traveling and getting to understand and appreciate many different cultures around the world. Another example you get a closer look into the lives of everyone around the world and allows you to help them get through any hurdles. These are some reasons on why gaining experience and understanding others is important.

Also when your out doing something you meet new people. For example your always talking to people when your out so you tend on making new friends. When your traveling and in need of a place to stay, by making new friends around the world you are possibly covered and dont have to spend a dime on a hotel. Another example when your out doing something you can possibly meet the right one, future (Husband/Wife). I've seen many stories of people traveling doing something and they end up falling in love with someone. This is why meeting new people by doing something is a good thing.

Some would argue that living an inactivity life serves purpose. For example you get to sit around and just hang out. Also you can make friends and do many things through the online world. Sure all these things are good you get to have a different form of fun. However you're just being plain lazy and choosing the simple way of living. Also once you have to go out into the real world you'll most likely be awkward and shy. This is why being inactive can be some what good but also bad.

In conclusion being able to travel and get to understand different cultures also gain experience is super fun. Also having friends from all around the world is just so cool and brings many different kinds of stories to the table. Even though living an inactivity life has it's flaws it also has it's pros theres so many different opportunities but your not living a fulfilled life. In my opinion we do accomplish a lot more in life being active and going out doing something than being at home being lazy not doing anything. This is everything on why I think we accomplish more by being active.

Because working with a group is more better have more ideas about of projects, every vary collaborate with the work making all together not distracting with the other students, and all in the group help with the ideas, what work need for the project, what talk about in the work, or what type of project made, what are doing the teacher said with the work.

Sometimes working with a group all have ideas, what are doing first, who make the tittle of the work , of who have the perfect idea of present ate the work or explain with the group what is the best are doing in talk about of the work and projects. when some students working alone is more complicate for sustain with take the best idea sometimes don't likes what are doing with the work. But when the students working together with a group i feel more benefits. Because when take one best decision some students said i like this idea or the others.

Some students like work with other students or not someone is quit not like express the idea or like only with self for example; Working with a group is more benefits work you can express your ideas for make the best work in the class or more best in the other students group some many student when make working alone sometimes catch good score or bad this students don't put penitencion in the class or distracting with cellphone or other things. When making work with a group other explain what are doing, what the teacher explain in the class what type of work make or project.

Working with a group all students feels more benefits for take the good grade for the make all together the nice job: However working in group is try the express the best idea in the group try help other, and one give the best example or make change the students in the group have the best grade to coming up someone students don't turn in the work this is affect the grades this is time to the change the grades for all sustain as making or learn more about what the teacher explain in the class for every vary pass the class.

6305A432AB38,"The Benefits of Having A Good Attitude.

It has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life. The importance of having a positive attitude can be bigger of what some people may think. A positive attitude describes how much effort people are putting into the problems they are facing. To see the good side of the things in life help to be successful. A positive attitude is the key to success in life because a positive attitude will help not to give up and will make things easier.

First, a positive attitude is the key to success in life because being positive help no to give up. For example, in the text ""People Who Became Successful After Adversities"", many people had a hard time before becoming successful. Even though, that people had adversities they always had a positive attitude towards the problems, that hope they needed to become someone. A positive attitude can change the view of the problems. Having a good attitude help people to not give up when facing adversities.

Furthermore, a positive attitude is the key to success in life because it makes things easier. For example, a person with a positive attitude will always see the good side of the problems. When people have a good attitude toward a problem, to face it becomes easier since people will look for a solution instead of being stuck. The attitude with which people face problems, shows the effort and how much people try. A positive attitude make things easier for people to be successful in life.

Many people may argue that a positive attitude is not the key to success in life because people does not always need to be positive to become successful. For example, there is many people who became successful without the needing of a good attitude to do things. This argument has a point, since people does not always have to be positive when facing something. However a positive attitude will help everything to go well. For example, people who have a positive attitude in life will attract good things, and everything will go well. Even though many people may argue that people does not always need to be positive, a positive attitude will help to make everything go well in life.

To summarize, it has been said that with a positive attitude people become successful in life because a positive attitude help not to give up, and a positive attitude will make things easier to go through. People with a good attitude do not give up when facing problems. Having a good attitude, will make things easier to go through. Some people may say that a positive attitude is not always needed to become successful, however a positive attitude is the key to success in life. To be positive in life is really important, since it helps people to face problems and become successful.

80C0814AF16D,"Dear, Dr. Generic_Name

Thank you for reading my letter. I hope it finds you well. I am currently a junior at Generic_School. I believe that the students should commit to career at a young age because. career can show how creative students can be, and have a had start to choose their careers before they get out of high school.

First, I would like to talk about how creative students can be in their career. When school. For example, I would like to express myself through my art to show my emotions and I love to excess myself through my art. It makes me feel happy but if I don't start choosing my career at a young age then how am I going to know what I want for my career and the students won't know what they want for their career when they get out of high school and that's how I would like to express myself through my career.

Also, about students having a head start to choose their career at a young age. for example, I would not know what to choose if I didn't start in high school it would be a waste of time for me to find a career if I didn't start at a young age, if I started at school then there won't be a problem for me to find one also I would rather start now then later on in my life and how Am I going to express myself if I don't have a career to start with thats why students should think a head of choose their career.

Last, students should think about what they want to do or be when they grow up because schools can help with your career when you need it, they can put you in a class where you want to learn about the career that you choose and it will make is so much easier for the student to start now. for example, if I where to choose a career I would have to tell my teachers what classes that I what to take for my career chooses it can help a lot of students with their career chooses it would be a problem for them to tell the teachers what careers they want and it would be more easier for them to start telling the teachers what career they want and put students in the class they want to take for their career but they have to trust their teachers first then they can tell the students what careers that they what to take or what good classes are good for this career that the student chooses and that's my opinion on students should be commit to a career at a young age.

Thank you for taking the time to read through my thoughts about career chooses that means so much to me and thank you again.

but what really the who harm what the please through a machiavellian emotional black mail based of fear of aggresion but under certain circumstances, evil acts can occur without the need of all of us. we have met peolpe who appear to be kind while they gain their trust and that is whea you realize that you are failing that you have been linked to bad people even in recent years,bad people there are people who have an evil background because of their environment can shape us to detect bad peolpe, the occurrence of very mediatic cases of munder or abuse of people make society silvery high because there are such people bad.

The virtues are the qualities we have and that provides a good for the same and for others is to say not knowing how to live whith another in my case, terrible things usually happen to me when I talked to my aunt, I did't know that she was aggressive discriminating well, not only does it happen to me, I have seen more people who go through terrible things that even their own family is bad with onw in case it is terrible to happen with bad people influence.

It helped me to show kindness to others because it impacted me and I want to impact others. Once you show small acts of kindness it can lead you to a better life. When people show small acts of kindness it can help someone's attitude to improve,

it can make someone's day better, help someone become a better person, and can help someone going through some hard times.

Showing small acts of kindness can help someone's attitude to improve by doing things that make them happy. Telling them what's wrong to say to someone so they know to not say it. Show love towards them because the attitude they have might may be really bad, but showing them love can help it improve a lot. Finally, they will slowly improve it might take time. The most important part is having a good attitude towards them even if you think it's not going to help it is because you're showing them how to give a good attitude back to anyone.

Helping someone's day better is by giving them a compliment it can effect them in the most positive way you can think off. Text them good morning and good night because you never know if there having a rough morning and night shows that you care. If you see them sad give them the biggest hug it can easily bright up there mood. Showing them acts of kindness can help them show kindness to others. SPREAD KINDNESS ALL OVER THE WORLD!!!! you won't regret it.

Showing acts of kindness will not just benefit the person , but it will also make you a better person. Helping someone become a better person can be easy or it can be hard it depends the way you do it. Doing little things can easily make someone a better person by giving them a smile or a hug. Once you helping someone become a better person can help you as well ! Most important is be yourself nobody is perfect in this world is okay take a deep breath and relax everyone cares for you.

Finally, a small acts of kindness can help going through some hard times is by being there for them in general you never know what there going through. Ask what's wrong and if there not comfortable telling you let them take their time it might be hard for them at first but they'll get used to it. Hang out with them 24/7 keep them active so they can forget everything they been thinking off recently. Be there for their family's as well they can also be going through a lot too.

Because they end up taking the wrong decision and I do understand that as student you just think to finish school and graduate to became profesional. The idea of finish high school in tree years instead four,

it will force students to chose the wrong career because they will not have enough time to get ready for college and they are still immature at that age.

First of all, students who are trying to finish their high school in tree years instead four they don't have enough time to prepare for college. They will not have build their knowledge to be succefull in callege. High School is means to prepare and help students to get ready for college, but spending less time in the school they would not have enough time to learn or cover all the subject in clase. In addition, they will not develop their skills and be succefull in college or their future. Some people might think the is a good a idea to finish high school in tree years because they can enter in college early and start to work but they might not be ready for college.

Forthermore, students at that ege still immature that they don't really know what they want to do with their life or if they want to go college. In addition, some kids might be even think drop off school and don't comtinue in college because school require time, persevere, dedication and concentration which a lot of the students don't have when they are immature.

Many tennegers of theis kids do not apy much atention in schoo because they are district in others things like hang out with their frends and playing sport that they do not even think much in school. For this reason, they need to spent four years in school instead tree so they can learn to be responsible. Some parents and studenst migh think that it not necesary spent four years at schoo when they can finish in tree but if they are immature and inresponsible they are not going to be succefull in their future.

Finally, students who want to finish their school in tree years instead four, they don't know what career to chose or if they want to continue in college. Forthermore, they are still immanute to decide what to do with their education that they end up chosing a wrong career.

7D519DA76B29,"The use of technology has spread all over the world. Everyone uses technology to talk to family/friends, text family/friends, pay bills online, shop online, etc. To me technology has both positive and negative effects. The positive effect is talking to people you can't see everyday or can't see at all, you can use technology to talk to long distance. A negative effect is the lack of getting stuff done, going outside for fresh air, no person to person communication, etc.

Instead of going outside to be with friends, family, etc most people stay home and just be on there phone all day, watching TV, on the computer, any device people have at home they use. Shopping has changed dramatically. Instead of going to the mall to go shopping most people can just stay home and go online to shop. Paying for bills or going to your bank has changed dramatically. You can pay all your bills, funds, credits, online. Everyone used to get out of there house and go to where they need to go to pay there stuff off, but technology as made it easier for people to stay home an do stuff online.

Half the people in the world think technology is not okay and should be gone. Young kids having technology is even worse because, kids dont play outside anymore they stay inside and play video games, talk to there friends online, watch videos, etc. Teen's are the same too. Almost every teen stays home and talk to friends, play video games like x box, PlayStation, etc. In schools teachers use websites to help students learn and understanding the subject.

Technology has changed the world. Technology does allow people to complete many tasks without talking to people. The world would have been so different if there was no technology made at all. Everyone would be outside more with there friends/family, traveling is the best way to get your mind off stuff and to have fun, eating in restaurants with people you love is the best. Ways to plan stuff out like traveling or eating with friends/family is either using a phone or just talking about it in person.

In conclusion, i think the limitation of human contact has a negative effect. Since technology has been made people have been getting lazy and lazy by the day. Theirs so much things we used to go outside for, we can just stay home and go online.

1649A2246587,"Benefits of being home school.

Have you ever felt like you could not handle school?, well let me tell you that you have options, in here you are going to know the benefits of being home school. When I was younger school was a challenge for me; There was always conflicts at school and the environment was really a distraction, not good for me. Attending to school from hone have a lot of benefits. Students are going to be more focus in their studies and they are going to understand the meaning of responsibility.

One of the reason why home school it's good for students is going to be that students are going to be more concentrate and focus on their studies. Students manage to work better if they are alone, since they do not have any distraction around them like: drama, bad influences, mean teachers, stress and so much more. This is really good for those students who want to get their stuff done and learn more efficiency. So attending to school from home is one good option for those who want to focus on their studies.

Responsibility is one of the most important skill that us like humans have to have. Being responsible is a hard skill to follow but it is the most important one since we use it on the daily bases. If students attend to be on home school they have to learn that is not easy and they have to be really responsible because they are not going to have a physical teacher in front telling them what to do. Therefore you have to get it by their on hands and learn the meaning of being a mature and a responsible person. Students are going to be more responsible because if thy have any project, homework or test they are going to manage the way to study and do their stuff by them self and using the tools of their online program.

I understand that some people may disagree and prefer students to go to a normal school since they are going to have more social life. Having social life it's really important but who said that being in home school means that they are not going to have any social life, it's the opposite because if students are all caught up with their things they are going to have so much time to hang out with friends and family.

In conclusion the benefits of being home school are really good since students are going to focus on their own things and studies also they are going to learn how important it's to be responsible. now days we use technology for everything because it let us have a lot of more options if people is struggling with school. so more schools should include some online programs for students who want to continue their studies from home. This is going to bring a big change in our community and more professional, responsible people.

25F1B2374A32,"Have you ever felt like you needed the guidance of another person? Many people have felt that way. It's never bad to ask for help or guidance from another person to get through things. Although having your life runned by someone else, seeking guidance isn't such a bad thing, because for some people making a big decisions on their own could be hard and stressful, and you could also be guided into a good and healthier life style where you are making better decisions and ideas.

A reason people should seek guidance is because for some people making a big decision on their own could be hard and stressful. But having someone there with them while making the decision would be more than helpful and could possible reduce the stress they have. For example my cousin would get very stressed out when she had to make big decisions on her own. But when she had someone there with her or she asked for help she wasn't as stressed as she was when she had to decided on her own. Making decisions on your own is hard and intimating, so why not seek the guidance of someone else to help get though that tough decision making?

Another reason seeking guidance is a good idea, is because you'd be guided into a better and healthier life style where you are making better decisions and ideas. As an example one of my closest friends was going through a dark time in her life and was making poor decisions. But she found someone she looked up to and asked for their guidance. So they guided her to a better life style, where she now makes better decisions than she did before. All because she had someone to guide and help her. Guidance really does play a big role in a better life style and better choice making on people.

However one might say, ""well your life is being runned by another person."" But it really isn't being runned by another person, because you also have the choice to listen to them or not. Or that your mentor or whoever is guiding will tell you what to do or how to live your life. In some cases they do tell you how to live your life, but they tell you how to live a better and healthier life, but can't force you to change in any way.

Having your life runned by someone else isn't ideal but seeking guidance isn't the worse idea because you'd be guided in good ways such as a better life style and could be guided through big hard decision making. In conclusion I believe peoples lives wouldn't be horrible with the guidance of someone because they aren't only guided you to better your life but they are also helping you with hard decision making and getting through things.",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.7902212,3.7914474,3.878644,3.8861265,3.8825364,3.8401384,3.8834603,3.7090888,3.9527547,3.569114,3.8282392,3.8987758,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,489,21,0.3537832310838446,23.285714285714285,5,4,"{'intimating', 'stressful', 'mentor', 'healthier'}"

, they sometimes talk to more than one person. Have you ever wounder why that is the case?, if you are a person who does not take advice from another individual , then you could use this skill, taking advice from another person can help you make better life choices, it will make you understand things more clearly and faster, and learn from them. Multiple opinions really is a foundation to a job like a mayor of a city, it is vital to take advice from the community in order to address problems and concerns. If it was just a city with no voice in the community then the city would fall into a bad place which no one wants to be in and the key advice is to receive it.

In the world we live in, we make a lot of important choices in life, some are big and some are small, but they effect our future and success. Next, advice from others can make you more wiser when you make your own choices, if

Abraham

Lincoln never saw how African Americans were treated for there skin color he would have never signed the documents for slavery to be band. if he never got advice he mostly likely would have never Andres the problems with having that toxic racism. If it wasnt for him, it would still be here today thanks to out 16th President, which boils down to good thinking and advice. At some point in our lives I know we got advice from someone we look up too,also what ever the advice they gave you, is an add on to bigger things, for example if a parent or guardian gives you some advice to never quit on things or problems that are hard and difficult for you, with just that you will Carey that for the rest of your life. Which eventually make you more wiser and resistant to challenges and in life. You will have a mindset that will help you be more successful and a hard worker. When you are at that point you will know what is right and wrong, from advice from your remodel, father, and mother. Multiple opinions is like trying different types of food from different chefs and if you just try it, you will see something you might like, if you never try something you will never see a different possibility taking advice is just like that. Only instead its intellects make the right choice to help you.

In Conclusion, advice is there to help you, opinions are there to guide you to something that gives you smarts to making the right choices in the world we live in live, sure not all opinions hear might not be in your favor. But just hear them out and be the best you that you want to be shaped in, advice will make yo wiser and more aware of scenarios.

BF5E7CD37E4B,""" Imagination is more important than knowledge ""

Can imagination be more important than knowledge?

I think that imagination can be more important than knowledge. Due to the imagination of some scientists have created a massive number of inventions that benefit almost all the people of the world in that part is when knowledge is created based in imagination. In movies of sci-fi the director imagine a space full of flying cars and gas stations in the space, one great example was in the movie ""Return to the future 2"" the director and the writer of the movie imagine a skateboard that could elevate one ore two inches from the floor and they put it in the movie, and now scientist invented a skateboard that can elevate four centimeters from the floor.

First of all, whiteout imagination the world couldn't be the same like we know it right know,the imagination can help to improve your knowledge. Think about that a world whit geometrical forms like squares or rectangles, horrible! For example: Bill gates was a normal person, studying in a normal university, and whit a normal family. But one day he imagine how to improve his knowledge of school of the systems of computers, then he invented windows, so thats is a great example o how imagination can change the world.

Also, the imagination can help people work. You use it in projects, you use it in homework, also you use it in tests (Like me right now). For example: I was in a project of a debate of countries, my team was N.Korea, i needed to imagine if i where in Generic_City presenting my statement to all affiliated countries of UN, so i began to write, i though i was going to lose, because my enemy was the Westerns powers, but then we could win due i could imagine if the situation was like i where a person of N.Korea speaking to orders governments.

Third, imagination makes you feel better, when you are bored or when you are sad, the imagination always can make you appear a smile in your face. For example: i meet a partner that was depressed, i tell him ""i know how you are going to be happy, imagine you and the people you love to be near are in a vacation, then imagine you are whit out problems, whit out school, whit out homework,etc. Now i think now you are willing to be without stress or difficulties in these day"", he told me he was better.

Finally, I think and many people does is that whit out imagination we couldn live happy and whit a lot of fun, knowledge is a part of the bast world of imagination. People famous and normal people are successful by the imagination they use in theres life.",3.5,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.9727554,2.8106406,3.1168056,2.912768,2.7533312,2.7730792,3.0566823,3.0383022,4.0110106,3.2967823,2.9781833,2.9938636,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,470,16,0.425531914893617,29.375,9,11,"{'whit', 'skateboard', 'bast', 'geometrical', 'rectangles', 'ore', 'elevate', 'westerns', 'whiteout', 'homework', '2'}"
DEDCC703F6FC,"Some school districts offer programs that allow high students to gradute in three years instead of the traditional four years. In my opinion, I feel like it is a good idea for some school districts to allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years.

The reason on why I feel like it is a good idea for students to graduate early is for Job oppurtunity, Entering college early and also Moving other places and starting a whole new life without no worries on education no more. Job oppurtunity's will help you out to save money, working on what you like doing and also find some jobs can help you get into college if you are interested. For example, I am studying about autotechnology and it is my second year doing it. My plans are to continue working on cars and hopefully find a job at a dealership so I can learn enough at college.

Another reason on why I feel like allowing students to graduate in three years instead of four is so that they can start off there future earlier than others by attending college. Entering college early is a good thing because you have some time to pick and decide on what you might want to study and learn about so you can get your masters on it or so that you can finish early and move onto what's next on your accomplishments in life. My school has the option to do Dual Enrollment which basically means starting college already and getting already college credits and still having to be in high school.

Finally, another reason on why I feel like graduating high school earlier than others is to have the chance to move to another country or state and start a brand new. Starting a brand new life can become very hard and very stressful. Starting a new life moving somewhere else means finding a better job oppurtunity, finding a olace to live in your budjet and also finding new people to hang around with but in my opinion at the end it will all be worth it. Some students are already looking somewhere to move on there own or with a roomate because they might be having problems at home that they don't want to deal with. At the same time of moving to another place you have to make sure that you are ready on what's about to come into your life. For example, paying bills, paying rent, house supplies and also if you have a vehicle make sure that your payments are on time.

In conclusion, I feel like allowing high school students to graute in three years instead of the traditional four years is a good idea. Job oppurtunity, Entering college early and also Moving to another state or country in my opinion are one of the main important things to focus on after finishing high school.",4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.6638808,3.5997136,3.7172847,3.7249446,3.6494176,3.601465,3.8361344,3.3248992,3.61424,3.395852,3.2054825,3.5748374,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,495,17,0.3919191919191919,29.11764705882353,9,2,"{'stressful', 'dealership'}"

Will it help you out and help you get a job that way, and is it important to set goals while your in high school and try to reach those goals in the future? All those question's are important to me because on my opinion those are ways to succeed in life. Those question's can help you in the future if you use them. Knowing what you would like to do in the future can help you out because your school might have classes or after school club's for it.

Yes it is important for young student to start looking for a career before they enter highschool. Why is it important? Its is important because if student's know what they want to do in future, they can take classes in high school to help them do that career. For example if I wanted to be a mechanic, I could take auto collision in edison, and that would start to help me out and give me experience. Knowing what you want to be in the future can help you out a lot, and you do what you like to do, and on my opinion knowing what you want your career to be gives you a advantage in the future.

For some people it isn't a problem to go to high school without know what there going to do in the future. They try to find out what what they like, and what they dont like as a career for the future. Some people go to college not knowing what they want to do and find out till there in college. My sister is one of them because she went into college not knowing what she wanted to do or be, but once she started going to college she found out what she wanted to do which was a ultra sound doctor. Now that she knows what she wants to do she studying and trying to reach her goal as being a ultra sound doctor.

If you already have a mindset on what you want to do you can set goal's for yourself, and once you reach those goal's set harder ones to reach. You can set many type's of goal's like one day owning a 5 bedroom house or owning your dream car. You can set goal's with what ever you want like in the future, present, at school , anywhere.

If your still in school a goal you can set is getting a and b honor roll or turning in all your work or even showing up to class everyday.

10A367BB87EB,"Based on Emerson's statement, I firmly agree that if you never try to do something beyond what you already know, you will never do something and know if you could have done it or of you were good at it. Based on my experience, for what I've live and for what I know, I strongly believe and agree with this statement. My brother for example wanted to be an engineer, with hard work and effort he made it. In the other hand we have Hitler, he went from being a simple art student to one of the most exponent dictators of Germany.

For example, my brother wanted to be an engineer since he was little, at the time he reach High school, he was sure what career he wanted for his future. He started taking courses that would help him get credits for college and getting involve with sports that would help him get scholarships. Also, he took classes that would help him improve his skills and understanding of his future career. Now with hard work and effort, he graduated as an engineer from Generic_school and he's happily working with his dream job. This shows that with hard work you can accomplish any goal and letting yourself grow.

Another example was Hitler, he went from being a simple art student to one of the most exponent dictators of Germany. At a young age Hitler had a dream, he wanted to study arts, he started working on it, but when he apply to college he wasn't accepted. That was the moment when Hitler decided to do something different, and experience something new that could change his life. With hard work and patience he did it. Even though he fail the first time, he didn't give up, therefore, he became a dictator.

Some people say that you should do what life gives you at the moment because even if you work hard, sometimes you don't reach what you were hoping for and the work is not even worth it, however, you should always try to do something to grow because if you don't, that's when life gets too bored, you don't have to be in the same spot your entire life. You need to let yourself expand and fly to grow and experience something beyond what you already know, something that will make proud at the end of the day.

In conclusion I agree with Emerson's statement that if you never try yo do something beyond what you already know, you will never grow and never have experience something out of your comfort zone. You'll never know if what you could have done was worth your time, which is why you should always try to something beyond what you have already master and challenge yourself to do bigger things that you never knew you could.

2538542762C0,"One topic that is frecuently dabated is if the schools should control students involvement in extracurricular activities. Some people think that the school should take control of the students extra activities and extra time. They feel that students need more educational activities to enrich their knowledgement at school. I believe that students should decided what they want to do with their extra time after school because some students have to work to help their families, some students have to get home earlier to take care of their sibbilings while their parents are at work and students like to do some other activities like sports, art or homework.

First, students have to work to help their parents and sibilings, it could be difficult to work and study at the same time, you get tired and all you think is get home and sleep, students who work do not have time to study for a quiz, test or do homework. However. Study hall could help them finish their homework, students who work don't get involved in extracurricular activities bacause they don't have time to make it through. But also they work for saving money for college, this is an a good idea because you are investing for your future. That is why students who work have to give up with some other acctivities that they want to do.

Second, some students have to get home early to take care of their sibbilings while their parents are at work, most of them can't afford a babysitter, this students might have the time to involve in a club, probably when one of their parents have a day off. They can do homework or other assigments for school or home while they are taking care of their sibbilings like made food for them, clean the house, laundry etc. That can get difficult for them because they have different responsabilities at the same time that they have to take care of school.

Third, other students like to do different activities like sports, they like to exercide everyday after school, there are many sports that hey can practice such as bascketball, baseball, tennis, gymnastics, etc. other students like to do art, envirroment and learn another language they can sign up for any club that they are interested on. This students are deffinetly involve in extracurricular activities from school, but they decided what they want to do with this extra time and the school do not have to tell them what should they do.

As have you read this are my reasons why I believe schools should not take control of the students activities after school.

F29244150DCB,"Schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by video conference. This might be a good option for students who really do need it but there is some other students who won't take this seriously.

I am writing this essay with the porpuse of desagreement with the idea of providing this ""benefit"" to the students, this is a way of making students lose interest in school because they might think that they don't have to take the conference every time and they willl think that they can do it whenever they want which gives to think that they aren't prepare for making good decisions when it comes with schools classes. In my opinion this is an opportunity that the schools gives to the students to drop out of high school considering that students are teenagers and they don't have the same amount of responsability than adults in most cases.

As a student I desagree with this option. We need to be able to communicate, create good group work, and meet people and I can assure that most of the students will ended up leaving this classes when they half way done. Being with more students make classes fun, helpful and even more interesting, students sometimes needs to have a adult teaching them and having a conversation face to face instead a computer taking to them.

Taking classes online is a benefit when you know how to manage time for example: My brother is a college student who is getting his master degree in Genetic Engineering some of his classes wasn't a requirement that he had to take them inside school so he decide to take them online so he can have more free time when it comes with work and school. He made a study plan which consist in spending one hour each day so he can focus on his online classes which helps him to study for every single of his classes.

My friend Generic_Name is a senior on high school and she decided to take two of her classes online so she can have enough time for work, school activities, and graduation plans. She has been overwhelm with all her activities and assignments which it made her drop out of one of her two online classes, she said she felt like she couldn't do it by herself which it made her start getting bad grades in her school classes.

I think this opportunity can make students get stuck and give up on school which it can't happen because we are the future.

There is so many good and bad effects allowing students use their phone for educational puroposes .They can be more bad reasons than good reason beause we have to think how really they are going to use their cellphones, and if it's for educational purpose.

I think allow their cellphones to students is not a good idea because we know that we are young people, and we are not going to use our phone just for educational purposes; we are going to use :our apps , social media ,and that is going to distract our attention in class, makes us faild or test because weare not using our resource for good reason; we know there are students without resposabilities and that's what make cellphones a bad opction.

Some people may think that use our phone in classes can be a good idea because we are going to have more access to technology at school, and more easy research for our classwork. Also people think that we are going to have more privacity for our work. Students said that they can be resposinble at the moment to use their chellphones just for educational purposes.

Allowing cellphones for students can have good and bad effects , it can have good effects because is a easy option for students having their phone for: research information resources, have easy acess to internet ,see videos educationals abut the subject, and find deep information about the subject. The bad effect for students can be :they are going to get distracting , they are not going to do their classwork,and for all that reasons they can lose their classes.

My first reason is cellphones in class are not good tools for students ,because cellphones distract and make students lose their attention to class.

My second reason is cellphones is not a thing that we need for learn because our parents, teachers ,family in their time was no cellphone ,and they learn by other resources like books ,so is not a thing that we really need. there are computers we can use them for when we really needed .

My third reason is that cellphone is not necessary for our educational purpose because we can have better resources than a cellphone ; we have the most beautiful thing in this world and that are books our better resource.

Some schools allow their students to use their cellphone to a educational purpose they think that is a good idea to have cellphones in their classroom but in my opinion is a distracting thing ,and is not necessary for our educational purpose ; we have good tools for example one are the books and internet but not using our cellphones at class because we know that we are not goin to use for educational purpose, and cellphone are going to distract us.

Students at grade nine through twelve get to learn what they want to be at a young age. It gets them more interested in the careers they choose in the nearest future. As they get through high school, they will know what path to take and what needs to get done. As soon as these young adults leave they won't have to stress of what their going to be. It's agreeable for students to start looking into their career at a young age.

Through out the years in High school, students will have the rights to choose their own courses, which follows up to their interest. For example: culinary arts, design multi media, masonry, and more. They can also choose any subjects such as: math, English, science, and history. These courses can also help those students with their future careers. While these students are learning they realize what they like and what they don't like. The upcoming goal for them by the time they leave high school is what they are going to become.

As these young adults think of what their going to be, they will think twice on some careers. Which gives them time to research options, and that research will reflect on which career is the best for them. While being young an thinking of a career students will have enough time to sort the ones the students like and the ones they dislike. The average life Span of a human is up to 75 years, which means 18 of those years can resolve of what the students are going to do when they grow up. Teen's can dream what they could be but can they put the effort in trying.

As in college, students will have to get credits to graduate high school, and need to pass a amount of exams.

From there the students path will flow to what college they'll go, when thinking young they got to think smart, which means they got to put the effort. When thinking of a career at a young age the students will have most of everything planned. Its never too much to notice that a student has more potential young than old because they got more time.

The students won't stress out because their not out in the world alone finding what to do.

Teens can commit to any career because they have had a whole lot of time to think of any career.

Its never bad for a kid to have dreams of being a cop and going for that career. Its always good to plan ahead, to always think and do. It's great that a young adult wants to think of it's future.

There are also other people who when it gets to having their own character traits they can't, therefore they get influence by others. Yes, we probably were influenced by other, but we didn't use all their character traits. There's lots of people who try to be others but it always dose not work out. If you want to pop out like the others best chance is you being your true self.

To begin with, we've been creating our own character traits since birth. We all learned how to speak, and walk differently. Your first word were most likely ""Dada"", or ""mama"". You kept watching shows that kept you entertain, or was it the games that made it entertaining that kept you going. How'd you learn how to walk, were you thought by your parents, or did you learn by yourself. it was either your parents were walking you, or you stood up and took your first steps.

In addition, you never stay young, you're always growing, our parents always wish we wouldnt grow. But it's part of life, now you're in the stage where time gets hard. Being a teen is mixed emotions, as like mentally, and physically. Times gets rough, you're struggling in school, or at home. You're having problems with friends, or family members. Being a teen is never a struggle nor negativity. You're learning what you need to improve and what you don't, you're helping yourself out. Guide yourself and continue making new character traits.

Finally, you see everything different, there's more responsibility, more weight to your shudders. your an adult, getting ready to pay bills and more. you've came a long way, youve been through ups and down. You've learn so much, use your knowledge, and continue to expand it. Do what's best for you and not for others. Use your character traits that you've learn and explore whats in front of you.

You are who you are, you choose how you live, how you move, and how life will be. Yes there are struggle in life but it doesn't mean stop and dont expand. have your character traits to help you, to guide you. Yet we're in a new year where people try to be other people, people try to be who they aren't. It's better to be yourself, than being fake to yourself. all these character traits that you've made, you worked, you used. It defines who you are and what you can do in life.

E73CF852AC12,"Positive attitude is the key to be successful in life. Most of the time older people or somebody you don't really know they will tell you to give all your effort and think smart. By having a positive attitude people feel more happy and comfortable. For example,when they have a positive attitude people stars to give you some advises from the experiences they have been through. In life to have a positive attitude we have to know how to deal with our problems even tho sometimes we might think we can not do it but, there is always a solution and after all that has happened we learn how to have a smart thinking and not giving up.

Having a positive attitude makes people have a good communication with others. When having a conversation with another person you can learn more about anything. Sometimes the people who has good skills or positive attitude in their jobs or any other occupations they have the opportunity to earn a higher position in their job. For example,all managers have that position because they have showed that they can have a good attitude with themselves and other people. This gives them the chance to be a successful person in life and help to become as them.

Education is also a big influence and how a person can have a good attitude and good values. Life teaches people how to control their emotions and help those who need it. In life to become successful people needs to have a goal and a plan how they are going to accomplish that. I know sometimes we have many problems and we think it not possible to have a good attitude but, there is a way how to deal with bad attitude and always have in mind the goal we want to accomplish one day.

There is always people who is going to say negative things to others instead of give them advises. Also many people think they can not do it after they try the first time and did not happened how they expected. People has to keep in mind that not always everything will be easy to get and there will be obstacles in life that will make you feel that you can not get what you want. By thinking and having a positive attitude people can make it become true just don not give until you have reached your goal.

In conclusion,in my opinion having a positive attitude can make people become successful in life. Be some educated persons and listen to what others say to them. Many older people or family might not want to see you fail and that is the reason for those who keep a positive attitude so they will be proud of those who protrude in life. Giving up would never be option for those who really have the desire to accomplish what they want.

5564D9D8C845,"""Studies have shown that one way to improve student achievement is to start an after school homework club."" Two-thirds of the students who join an after school activity club are more likely to succeed in academics then students who do not. Schools should establish an after school homework club because it can help students finish their homework, become more socially interactive , and give students some teaching experience.

Firstly, an after school homework club helps students finish their homework in time. Many student get a low grade in their class because of unfinished homework. They were not able to finish their homework because, they did not know how to do it. Teachers do not usually have the time to go through each student, and help them in class, but some teachers volunteer to meet with students who have difficulty in certain subjects in an after school homework club. Joining an after school homework club is a great way to finish your homework in time. Sometimes teacher might even give students some tips and tricks on how to solve a question, that they would not give out in class. My friend Generic_Name used to have a lot of difficulties with his math homework until he joined the after school homework club in our school. He learned many tricks on how to solve a math equation and even taught a trick to solve an ""Integer Slope Inequality"" equation.

Moving on, an after school homework club can help students become more socially interactive. While in an after school homework club, you can find students with the same difficulties as you. This will give students something to relate to and not feel out of place. Having group discussions on how to solve a problem and having group projects in your club will also help you be more socially interactive. My friend Generic_Name made many friends by joining the after school homework club in our school, and grew a lot of confidence. He is now much less nervous when talking to people than before.

Lastly, homework clubs can give students teaching experience for if they want to be a teacher when they grow up. Students can volunteer to help other students finish their homework in an after school homework club. This will give the student a lot of experience on how to teach, and deal with other students. There is a team of students is our school called the "" Junior Honor Society"", which helps students with academic difficulties every day after school. As a member, I have learned about a lot of ways to teach someone else, and because of my desire to be a teacher one day, this helps me a lot.

Schools should establish homework clubs because it can help students finish their homework, become more socially interactive , and can give students teaching experience.

43EE2C3C7EB5,"Have you ever wondered why teachers encourage working in groups? working in a group is far more beneficial, as you get to achieve faster, work productively, as well as learn how to work together with people, and sometimes, people you don't get along with. Working in a group can help bring in more thoughts, and bigger ideas, therefore i recommend we start working in groups over working alone.

Groups help you get things done faster, as you divide up the work between the members, more things are done at once, for example; while I write up an essay about a project, someone else can design the project!

Working in groups can be more thoughtful, while the group discusses the project or work, they are able to combine thoughts and think of more ideas and make the work thoughtful. Groups are also very fun! Have you ever had to work alone and just wasted your time staring at the clock go ""tik tok tik tok"", because of how boring things are going? In groups you are able to talk to friends and discuss the project as you go along and work with people you like.

Working in groups result in a better job done, as students get to divide the work based off what their good at, helps them make the project or work better. Students in groups are able to help each other by correcting each other' mistakes they are also able to teach their group mates things they dont know as well as share ideas and thoughts together to improve the work or project being made. Often times I see students' struggle but once in group they are always there to help each other improve and that is why working in groups is helpful.

It may be argued that students could possibly not get along together in groups, however, once students are forced to work together, they are also forced to get along to achieve and succeed. Something to keep in mind is that in the future, students might have to work with people they don't like, but have to get along with in order to succeed in their job and that's why we should prepare students and teach them to get alone with people. For example; I've had times where i had to work with people that i didn't get along with, but throughout the project we had to work together productively in order to succeed and get a good grade, and since that project we are now best friends.

After all, the decision is yours but I will encourage you to start assigning groups for projects, as it will help get things productively done with less time, and it will also teach students to get along with each other, create friends, and learn how to work as a team. Working in a group is much more beneficial and should start taking place more often.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.8060179,3.7807145,3.9298096,3.9135952,3.871636,3.8223178,3.6776392,3.8604808,3.7637417,4.2220736,4.2167535,3.8953285,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,492,16,0.3638211382113821,30.75,6,3,"{'productively', 'discusses', 'correcting'}"

People can get a job by using technology, shop, and talk to each other no matter where they are. Now days people can't live without technology because it had made their life easier and it is hopefull to everyone who works, who goes to high school and, also if you stay at home. Technology allows people to do many tasks without having contact with others.

Now days to find a job, people do not go to the companies and ask for an application. They use technology to make a resume and just wait on what the companie is going to say. It is easy for people who doesn't have transportaion,

they can get a job by staying at home and use technology. People who works far away from their house need transportation if they want to call the boss they need a cellphone or something that has something to do with technology. when technology didin't exits it was hard for people.

Technology helps people to shop by just using the internet, now days we have a lot of stores that people only can buy stuff by using the internet and it is good because if someone want something they just need to use the phone and go to a store application. Over 98% people around the word use technology to shop. If people shop online they're not going to loose a lot of money because the prices that they have are good. this is really hopefull to a lot of people and to people who play games the internet is a good setting to nuy.

technology helps people to talk to each other no matter where they are, it is know that our planet is big and people lives all around the word, some people don't have the opportuntie to travel to see their family, friends and get to know more about our culture, but now that peole has technology it is easier because you can talk to peole that is on the other side of the world, you can get to know more about our culture just by looking at pictures or videos or you can do stuff without speaking to another person.

technology has helped people a lot in everything day do every day, if people stay one day without technology they are going to see the diference of having technology and not having it. becuase if you go to your job you use it, if you go to school you use it, of course people can live without it but is going to be harder to do the stuff we usually do, that is why people continue making more and more technology to make adiference in our planet and to make people's lives easier.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.1519346,3.0913985,3.3082206,3.1915314,3.0535543,2.9991655,2.5491188,3.0404763,3.2575035,2.849819,2.48511,2.8156614,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,494,17,0.3684210526315789,29.058823529411764,16,6,"{'98', 'exits', 'online', 'internet', 'videos', 'cellphone'}"

Some people think that are impossible to change, because they had been said or think that you cannot change your first impression, when you at first meet or start knowing someone, that is not true because clearly you can change your first impression, even though it can be the same or different as the first impression you had at the beginning of everything, but you may also be insecure or confuse of your own thoughts and feelings.

I am in disagreement with this prompt that it has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change, because just imagine clearly your first impression it may not be the same when at first you start knowing someone, when at first you meet someone, or even when at first you look someone by the first time, people may also said that is impossible to assume your first impression at someone, because your perspective of someone may be different from another perspectives of others, you may have the same perspective or also different from other people.

The day when at first came to United States it was really hard for me and for my family from Mexico, I was really nervous and also a little scared, it was one of my dreams that became real, I was so impressed and surprised of everything, the first impression that I used to have of United States changed, now that I am living in United States, the impression is different because now I know how is to live in a different country. Not always is going to be how you thought it would be, but it can be even better, even thought your impression was different or was the same at the beginning.

The day I came to this school Generic_School, my impression from when I meet my counselor Generic_Name were different from my impression after I meet her, I thought she was going to be really mad and mean counselor or I even thought she was going to be a counselor that doesn't like Hispanic people, but all my thoughts were wrong, my impression was really wrong because my thoughts about her were wrong, now that I know how is my counselor, my first impression and perspective changed from the one that I used to have and believe.

In conclusion, as the end of this prompt that it has been first impressions are almost impossible to change is wrong, that is not believable because your first impressions and your own thoughts can be wrong, even though you thought it was going to be something at the end is not how you thought it was going to be, first impressions are possible to change because they can be wrong even though your perspective can be true, or it can be also wrong.

However does that believe that is not a good idea that students commit at the young age one reason is that they will file tire , because when they want to pay atention to math class and they see that the teacher is talking to much they are going to say no I want to sleep to to be in this class borring,second when they are in the corridor study for a quiz and they will be talking about the career and when they are going to take the quiz they will know nothing because they did not study .

Does who believe that is a good idea for students to commit a career at the young age give one reason ,one reason is that tey can see can the life is very hard and they will have to do there own thing ,second is that they can buy a car so because if they shoes a good career they are going to resif a lot of money so can have a car and help there family with other thing at home .

Finally that career it have to be good some you are not going to be looking for another commit career because you try hard and ask you family and teacher to help you to fun a good one, second if you like that career you most talk wit you mom or dad that you are happy with that and tell you teacher that help you to found that career and tell her can you will talk to other students to come and talk to the teacher so she can help them .

Summer projects can be fun, if only they were chosen by students. If the students were to pick their own projects depending on the subject; they would be interested, more likely to do it, and enjoy as well.

teachers spent a whole summer or a school year coming up with a topic for the students to do during the summer. And, it turns out that the students aren't giving it much though or effort towards their given assignment. That can be waste of the teachers time and energy, but if the students were to come up with a topic and idea of their own they would do the project.

if students were to choose their project, they would more likely to do it because its on something they want to learn and their curious. when students are curious they tend to explore their curiosity and be more drawn in the subject and want learn more about it. students can come up with great ideas when comes to doing their own projects. choosing a topic of your interest in a projects can explore students mind, and do the things they would never though of doing.

The summer project can improve your grades in the class. for example a student that struggles a lot in class either because the they cannot keep with pace in class, with summer projects they can work on their own pace. and if students are not great at working in environment full students this gives the a chance to do in depended study. summer project can give an opportunity for students to increase their greats. if students were to chose their own assignment they could at pace that worked for them, and they wouldn't have to worried about due time date. students would have the whole summer to finish the project, and if they did not finish it, when they an entire summer to do it, now that's just being lazy and it can effect their grade.

Subject can have a great impact on the student. If student is given an assignment on a certain subject their is a chance they would start procrastinate or not do it at all.

therefore they would have zero interesting on doing the summer assignment. for example if i had a history project and a science project. And if my science teacher were to give me a project to do a research paper on how gene mutate, as interesting that sounds i would not do it because science does not fascinate me as history.

Being able to choose a project of your own can be fun that way, it gives a student to look forward to do their work and be more fascinated it. Students should design their summer project; because that's less work on the teacher,

it gives them an opportunity to just think outside their box, and they can make their teachers proud for doing their work, so they can look forward a better school year.

4ACFA2D3D0A1,"In my opinion I believe that it is better that we accomplish more it will make us more active. Im a firm believer that inactivity does not serve any purpose. This is the reason there is daylight and also nighttime; when its day time you get things done and when its nighttime you can rest or spend time relaxing. I also seen that the more you do the less you are to complain. Now let me explain to you some reasons why you should always accomplish a lot through out the day.

My first thing I would like to start with is that there was a study at ""The University of Florida"" it showed that a person that does completes lots of tasks usually does better academically. Also you can get stressed if your not doing lots of work suffer health issues being active is important. The university tested 40 students 20 of them would show up to class on time get assignments done and come everyday. They would also be inspired to do better with there studies.

It is also sometimes good to be inactive but that would mostly be during the night time when you have had a long days work you can sit down and just relax.

Being a active person also makes you a more preferable person when you are working. People tell you that you are a hard worker when they see that you are doing your work on time. You are also preforming to the best of your availability. At my work I had this conflict with my co worker and instead of me arguing I just told her she was right and let it go. This lady would always be angry because her work she would be stressed out and yelling but that again comes in with being a lazy person.

Being active can keep you out of trouble or addiction because you will not be so bored throughout your days. You will keep your head so busy that you will be so tired that you wont think about anything else just about taking rest and going home. Keeping bust is also a huge stress deliver because it makes your brain process things more quickly. Unlike with being inactive you just stay at home and do not do anything. Your brain will just be thinking all day about what it will do and you will get worried from not doing anything throughout the day. These are some of the reasons I believe it is good to be positive and not to be to worried.

It is always good to consider why the night time and the day time was made the sunlight was to keep us awake and then the dark was made to make us fall asleep. Also keep in mind that the time you spend doing nothing can be put for good use and you can never take back the minutes or hours that you have spent doing nothing. These are some of the reasons it is always good to be a active human being so that you do not have any problems later in life.

It is very important in the life, but to learn the value that it has sometimes failure is also necessary. Also success is not something easy to get, but without loss calm could get it with enthusiasm. Success has an role important in the life of many people since it is something that is necessary in their academic level, their jobs, and their goals to have a better future.

First, success is difficult to get at the academic level, but the students need know that although they are failing with effort they could get it. Since to get it, they need to study a lot without loss the hope of getting success. Also they need to practice each step to do more easy their activities and have a better success. For example: if students loss any test they need to study and practice a lot to get their success with enthusiam. For this reason, the importance of the success also depend of failure to failure to learn.

Second, in the work, the success depend of many dedication and is absolutely necessary working a lot to get it. If the employees is not working well, the problem could be that the company not could have success and the employees could be exonerated of their jobs. Moreover, if they are exonerated their jobs, they need to looking for another jobs without loss the calm to get their new jobs with a great enthusiasm. For example: An employee was farawell for does not a good report, but continuous practicing and learned to do a good report after that the employee found a good job did a very nice job. Sometimes the success in the work is not easy to get, but neither impossible.

Finally, the people have many goals in their future, but also have obstacles to get success. The goals are difficul to accomplish, but not difficult to do. Furthermore, to realize their goals, they need to keep completely firm their ideas to find the success. Sometimes, they can failure, but they have the capacity to do anything and accomplishment their success for example, A family want to go to the beach, the problem is that they do not loss money to their vactions, yet they were to the beach because winning money working hard and with a great emotion they arrived to the beach. All goals can get with dedication and effort.

In conclusion, from failure to failure, the success can be possible and get it with a great enthusiasm. In the academic level, job and goals for future there are not impossible to accomplish the success. Does not matter the difficulty that everything have, the most important is realizing all with success, but without loss enthusiasm. Success is important, but the most important is learning to surpass failure to get it with enthusiasm.

First, when we where kinds we have only positive attitude,we only think in positive things as what we want to wen we grow up, for example: some kinds said theta they want to doctors,astronauts, and teachers; some kids said that they want to be doctors because, they want to save lives,

and find the priest for the cancer, some kids said that they want to be a astronauts because, they that to go to the moon, some kids said that they want to be teachers because, they want to teach others kind something that they know and they know is gonna be helpful for them in life.

You would want to go to the Bahamas because the beach is crystal clear. You can see all the baby fish that are swimming around you which is so cool! I always try to catch one but it never works. There will also be very colorful snails stuck on the rocks. They look poisonous so I never try to touch them. You can also go surfing there. I am too scared to surf so I just lay down on the surf board and relax. There are coconut trees near the beach which looks really cool. One of my favorite parts is when big boats pass by and big waves come your way.

Another reason why you would want to go to the Bahamas is because the restraints there are like no other restraints here. The restraints there look big and fancy. The best part is that you get to eat at a restraint for every meal because there is no store there for you to buy food and cook it up. Although that may be a little expensive, but you have to keep in mind that you are on vacation. It takes about ten to fifteen minutes for them to serve your food. I don't know about you, but to me that is not long at all. The food taste so good! They also never over cook your food too! One of my favorite dishes is the shrimp pasta. If you go to the bathroom it is super clean and it smells good too. I hate it when I go in a bathroom that is dirty and smells bad.

Another reason why you would want to go to the Bahamas is because of the awesome, clean, and fancy hotels there. The hotels there are nice and refreshing. It is super clean. There are two closets, two beds, and one bathroom which is pretty good if you ask me. There is also a big TV right in front of the two beds. There is also free WiFi for you to use but that is kinda unless when you have a big TV right in front of you unless if you want to play games on your phone which is what I do. There is also a mini fridge for you to put your water so when your hot just grab the icy cold water out of the fridge to drink. The best part is that there is air conditioning and it actually works.

These are all the reasons why you should go to the Bahamas. All I am trying to say is that the Bahamas is a great place to visit with your family and friends.

98CD7819C7EF,"Some people believes that making mistakes is how peoples move on to success. Othes believes that is if we are determinated person and having positives thoughts without limitations. Some others people realized right before they are committing the mistake and they are just avoiding them. Although some say, successing in life without failures, our lifes wouldn't make sense, because we would not learn how to be success in our life's. Actually, successing in life with failures is more baneficial to our life's, because we learn how to believes on us, and we may have a life without doubts.

As a result, if we are the kind of person who doesn't makes any mistakes and realizing to success. i think that we wouldn't know what are we doing wrong to be determinated person. Also most of the people wouldn't have knowlwdge to succes in their lifes. Actually, when people cling to themselves isn't good for their goals in lifes.

However, I believe that making failures is how we move on to succe ss in life and is more beneficial to our life's. Otherwise i can tell the 80% of the people belives that making failures is how we learn to success and we become a civilized person. Sometimes most of the people have goals to achieve in their life's. As a matter of fact,

when we are setting goals to our life's and we can't get that goal it's because we are doing something wrong and we don't even realize what's wrong with it. its when we are learning to be focus and making sure next time to be success and whatever we did wrong.

In fact, sometimes it's hard to when we have had failures a fewers times, because we do not want to commit mistakes, but i think that is a beneficial for most of the people. Because the most mistakes we have and at the same time we overcome to have more experience in life. First of all, when we fix what we did wrong. Also I believe that fixing problems is a good way to be success in life. second of all, my suggestions are that to be a positive person, and determinate, smart, and wise person it make us a better person in success.

In conclusion, some people believes that having failures is how we are success in life and others don't think that way. However i do believe so that to be a success person, we have to fail a fewers times, because it's really important to me to be a determinate person.

Pretending can make you feel guilty, it could make you feel like you're lying to someone about yourself, so think about it.

To say nothing of, i agree that having a positive attitude is the key to success in life. For this prompt i have some reasons why i agree why having a positive attitude is the key to success. In addition,climate change would always be the problem we would have with our earth but, hoping it would'nt be as bad as today.

Further more, the First reason why i agree to having a positive additude is the key to success because, having a good mind can help you get things done faster. For example, during school hours i complete my work on time when im not feeling too tired, or when im feeling like im doing great, and when im having alot of good energy. Having a good mind to gets things done faster, can help you not stress about uncompleted work. A positive mind can have very good idias and accomplish your goals. In conclution, having a positive mind can bring important things done faster.

In addition, having a positive additude gives good vibes everyone likes, enlighten other people day, or can lead to good things in your life. For example, when im working and im having a bad day there always a customer who changes my mood to a very positive mood and i start to work better. Having a good mood or mind can leave a good job. To conclude for, having a good mind or great attitude can lead you to big important things in your life that can lead you to greatness.

Third reason why, good attitude can help your mental health , help other people around you, or people you very close to. For example, i would be very close to my older sister because she always gaved good additude,good vibes, and she had more expirience in life that she could help me with. To say more of, this example can lead you to be more confident in your self. To say nothing of, this can also lead to feel good about your self and love your self mentally and emotionally.

Finally, having positive mental health can bring yourself to have good feelings about your self to get things done and feel good about it without hesitation.

In conclution, Having a Positive addittude is a good thing we should all do in our lives. In addition, to having these reason why i agree to having a positive attitude is the key to success in life is because, without having a good additude we wouldn't get things done and things would get things done the wrong way or not good enough to be great. Furtheer more, not having a great additude can lead to not accomplishing your goal or be successful as you would like in life.

If they were to change the school routine to kids having to have breaks for 3-4 week's they wouldn't come back with the same effort as they do when they come back off of summer break.. For example if I were to leave shcool for 3-4 weeks I wouldn't want to come back to the same classes and with the same routine, It's just that Students do retain the information they teach they would have to go over it just so they get back on track. But the fact of having year-around school isn't it just doesn't make a diffrence. and im an sure that kids wouldn't like to have only 3-4 weeks off school after all the time they spend in school

This is why students should have a right amount of school and a certain amount of months off. a year-around school benifits teachers not students. because they if they did have a year- around teachers wouldn't have to worry about re-teahing it again to the students because they would expect them to already know what they are taking about. so they should have a regualr schedual for te schools board to follow.

But at the same time the fact of not having to go to school for weeks sounds good. when their break is over they would have to go back to school not only that but they would have to pick up from where the left off at first. I feel like leaving in the middle of a lesson that is important that really wouldn't have the studets as much. if they were to change the school routine it would just mess things up with the students and their grades and that would e more work of teachers. What if some important test is coming up for the students and they only have a certian amount of time to get things done within the time period and then they would leave on break what if the teacher couldnt get everything done in time then te whole class would fail the test.

This is why they should just leave school as it is just so that student's and teacher's wouldn't have to go throught all that trouble, Just get what they need to get done within the time they are their and then when they are done with all the work they needed to get done with they could leave for summer break, just so students dont stress over the facts that they have to get things done in a certain amout of time.

Some may argue that student should not attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Students that are at home will most likely be distracted, and will not finish their agenda. Some students will have a hard time teaching their selves. Also it would not give the students, the chance of experiencing what it is like in school.

It would really benefit the students, who are not socialize and have problems contacting with other students or teachers. Every students grew up differently, and also some other students have had a bad childhood experienced and it reflected on how they act in their current life, by giving them a chance to study where they are comfortable at would give them a chance to show what they can really do, because not many students have that many option or chances to show their full potential. They can not do that by having to stay in school, and force them selves to socialize to other students or teachers it would all just be a distraction.

Also, it would help the students who had a bad experienced at school. Students who experienced getting bullied at school can caused them to stop going or the will to study and be successful in life. Bullying even nowadays still have so much impact on why some schools are really not on their high standards. And it showed that students are highly affected by it. It showed that it is a nightmare to some students, but now having the online classes will pull them away from that and really focused on their studies.

Furthermore, students who are in their comfort zone, will likely be able to focused and not have any distraction. By having that comfortless and being in your zone of learning, will highly benefit you to show your potential. Being in the right environment also help students focused.

For example: think that you designed a machine from your imagination about a robot maid who can help you to clean your house , do your laundry, make you dinner, washing the dishes, etc. From your idea, you made the robot and It worked just the you wanted it to work. And then your robot went to the market and the people brought it and loved the machine. How would you feel when you see your robot went viral in the world and people liking it? Your robot machine went from an a imaging thing to a big successful robot machine.

Also It helps your mind get stronger. When you thinking about anything, your brain is running from one place to another place to get the next task. In a human brain, we do 5% conscious and 95% unconscious things everyday. You are learning something new everyday, your brain collecting data based what you do in a everyday life basis. When you imaging something, your brain brings back the data from your past and puts it in your imagination. In that way,you know what you should in your imaginary work. Also, In that way your brain are becoming more conscious by your little thinking process and it's making your brain stronger everyday.

Imaginary can make you an open minded person. If you are good at imaging, when you are gonna talk to other people and they tries to explain you their situation, First, you will imagine yourself into that situation. Second, you will understand what they have been went through. Then you will think what should I do to make that person feel better. Next, you will give them some helpful advises that will make them better. If they feel safe around you, they will be more comfortable to tell more about them in future.

In conclusion, I think imagination is better than knowledge. It makes you a good person, It makes you open minded, It helps your brain to get stronger. And that way you will be able to help others'    ",3.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.527343,3.3879378,3.5890162,3.431584,3.2657006,3.524393,3.2060359,3.61403,3.4278898,3.4060495,3.1666875,3.208928,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,489,31,0.4212678936605317,15.774193548387096,7,8,"{'imaging', 'robot', 'advises', '5', '95', 'viral', '100', 'minded'}"

This decision should solve with their families, because this decision shouldn't made by school, school should help not control students to do the extracurricular for their good experiment with other student or get involved with different team works, and some student don't want to do or stay after school program or any other extracurricular activities.

First, whether student wants to join or do extracurricular activities they should ask parents or families first, because some parents don't wants to do the extracurricular activities. Example, some students have a lot of homework, project, tests or their different school works. Some parents don't want let the kids or students to do the extracurricular activities because of their other school works. This can cause their student fail the school or other stuff can happened to them. This is why extracurricular activities decision should made by families not by schools.

Then, school should help not control students to do the extracurricular for their good experiment with other students or get involved with team works. Some school wants students to do join clubs, sports, and any other after school program, because some after school program needs students to do join their program by forcefully. Example some sports coach ask to do join their team but the student don't want to join for some kind of reason, and sometime they email or call to their parents to let them join our programs. Some student don't want to join any after school program for some reason. This is why after school program or extracurricular activities should made by families decision.

Lastly, some student don't want to stay after school program or any other activities. Some student are already tired from school example, some students is already taking lot of extra classes at school and they probably have lot of test and quiz or even homework. If they decided to do after school program or any other extracurricular activities then it's up to their families choice, but most of students don't want to stay after school because they already have lots of homework, projects, prepare for their quiz and tests. If school wants to control student to get involve with any other after school activities then it can cause students grades, lack of sleep, and other stuff can happen to students. This is why extracurricular activities decision should made by their families or by parents.

This is why I want parents or families to make a decision about after school programs. This is the three reason that I want families make a decision about after school programs not by school. Although many people believe that school should control student involvement in extracurricular activities. For me I disagree that school should not make a decision for students, decision should made by students families or by their parents for my three reasons.

Sometimes student do not sleep as well, or they do not have much energy to play, because they do not eat before start the game. Everybody needs to know before they have a game we need to eat healthy, and drink enough water. Sometimes famous death for that kind of reason, so we need to learn about the experience. Life is very important for everybody, so we need to look what's the first thing we can do before they think and act too.

Family is more important than the game, so they do not have time to practice. Sometimes family want to explore places for example; New York, Florida, and Boston that state has beautiful place to swim play, and we can do everything. That's why student do not have time to practice the game. Game is an important thing they can learn too much, and maybe in the future they can get a award like a professional or famous on games.

Some students do not have time to practice, because they need to work to pay the bills for example; pay the insurance for the car, pay the rent where they live, and also pay the bill for the cellphone. That's is the reason we do not have time to practice. That's why we failure the game, because we work at night and then we are going to school all day. When it is time to practice the game we do not have energy to play, so that is the cause we lost the game every time. We needed to work a part-time on that way we got more time to practice the game, so the next time we can win the game. Sometimes the family do not help them, because they said we need to learn how they make a money to obtain the food for each person.

Eating healthy is good for everyone, so we need to eat every day. Also we can eat fruit every time, because that has to much protein. That's is the first thing we can do before beat the team, because that make they strong. they need to go the gym too, because that help you to get a healthy body. Sometimes the first thing we can do is eating, and then go to sleep this is not a good choice for them.

Please help all the students who is trying to work and continuing to go to school, because they are the future on the world. We need to help them because sometimes we have a dream, but no body try to help that's why students can't realized they dreams.

E9E68651B168,"I disagree on extending school hours. I disagree because if the school board adds more morehours to school, students won't pay much attention to the teacher or staff. Another reason is that students will start disrespecting teachers because they have too many hours and they will start to get more tired or start to go a sleep. I also think that teachers might get anoyed by students replying on why the school board added extra hours of school. I think that instead of adding the extra hours to school, the school board should just make the extra hours optional after school. This should take place after school so kids can come and learn more about life and school.

First of all, I disagree because if the school board adds more hours to school students wouldn't be able to concentrate or pay attention in class. I believe that if students don't pay attention in class or to the teacher, the teacher will get very upset and students will start to get in trouble or would start losing points. I believe that the students don't pay attention in class or to the teacher, they would begin to be disrespectful to teachers and won't be respectful to others. I believe that students should tell their parents to do something about the school board wanting to increase the amount of hours in school. Kids should work very hard and keep up the good work and not be disrespectful to others or to the teacher.

Second of all, I don't agree because I think that students will start to disrupt or question their teacher about why the school board wants to change or increase the amount of hours students have in school. They are going to start asking a lot of question and their teacher isn't going to like that. I think that students should ask the school board why they are going to increase the amount of hours in school. Students should talk to their parents on why the school board is extending the amount of hours. Students should just be able to do the normal hours of school instead of doing extra.

Third of all, I believe that the school board shouldn't increase the amount of hours the should just make it an after school activity. I think that the school board should just make it an after school activity instead of increasing the amount of school for students. The school board shouldn't extened the school hours for students because students can just study hard for something or teachers should go over the subject the are learning about so they can learn and understand. If they just stay after school theyh will get so board and they wouldn't want to be there.

I decline on the idea that the school board wants to increase more hours for students. I decline beacuse students will get very bored and wouldn't want to do anything. The school board should think it over again and not extend or increase the amount of hours for school.

The school board should not add one and a half hours to each school day because all the students will got stress,all the school program will get delay, and the all starts to skipping school.

The first reason why the school board should not add one and a half hours to each school day is because all the students will got stress. Some students can get depression by learning to much. They don't want to study anymore because of the long day in school. They will get very tired of sitting all day. They will not do their homework because they have to memorize a lot of thing at school are ready. They don't have a lot of time left at home to study or do in their homework. They will not interesting in school anymore. That's the first reason why the school board should not one and a half hours for each school day.

The seconds reason why the school board should not extending the school day is because of the school program and activity will got delay. So if the school board add one and a half hours of school all the after school program will get delay. No more students want to stay after anymore because if to late. Just think about the transportation from the school. If a student live in a rural area they have to wake up at 5 A.M to get ready for school because from his/her house is one hours away for the school. If the student planning to stay after school she/he may not get home at 7 P.M. And he/she have to get home before 7 P.M to be available to do her/his homework. That is all the reasons why school should not extending the school day.

The cost of electricity every year is over 6 millions dollars, just think about how much it can cost the school board if they add one and a half hours of school each day? If the school board add one and a half hours for each school day, all the students can learn more thing. The last reasons why the school should not add one and a half hours because the cost of electricity. Every years the school board have to pay over 6 millions dollars. If the school board spend over 6 millions to the electricity every years then how many millions for every thing else. The school board will not have a lot of money let to updates the school.

The school board should not add one and a half hours to each school day because all the students will got stress,

It has been said that 1st Impressions are almost impossible to change. This statement to me is wrong. Impressions can be changed not only because people always mature in life, but also people may change by others actions, and they way life treats one another.

Impressions can be changed because people mature in life. For example, my mother tells me all the time that I was not the same kid she raised because of my appearance and the way I act around others. So, it is because I have matured that I have changed, if I was 7 or 8 years old, I would be shay to talk to people and try to be polite to not cause problems. Also, people would never smoke or even talk back if their impressions matter like they did when they were little. So peoples impressions change when you get mature in life

Impressions can be changed because of the people around them. For example, my little brother may not do all the things that he does now if it weren't for my behavior around others, back then my little brother would be very shay to speak. Then he saw how I spoke to others; with security, courage, and calm. He learned that from me and now he talks to anyone he enjoys hanging out with. So, with people being and influence in someones life, you would make a good or a bad impacted on someone's life which would change someone's impression for sure.

Impressions can be changed because the way life treats one another. For example, a week from my birthday I was going to turn 14 my dad got arrested; I did not feel like I wanted to throw a party, I hated everything cause I said to my self life isn't fair, Then the next morning in school, every ones impression of was that I never felt sad, I was a happy young teen; Until the next day everyone was wishing me a happy early birthday. I didn't feel happy about it because my mind was all caught up on my fathers arrest. People noticed that and their impression changed because I never felt happy in my life, everything went wrong. Instead of everyone greeting me every morning, they just gave me space because they thought that I was depressed and I was for a good time. Now people take me seriously now because I didnt make jokes. So peoples impression changes ever since they saw the way life wasn't fair.

In conclusion, It has been said that 1st Impressions are almost impossible to change. This statement to me is wrong. Impressions can be changed not only because people always mature in life, but also people may change by others actions, and they way life treats one another. All of these reasons are true because no one really knows what life, maturity, and the people around you can do to affect someone's 1st impressions of you.",4.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.5045886,3.4017675,3.5861578,3.5331807,3.3988543,3.4346395,4.0240097,4.0483146,3.63248,3.9887285,4.1040125,4.0388646,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,502,24,0.4003984063745019,20.916666666666668,4,7,"{'someones', 'impacted', '7', '14', 'matured', 'shay', '8'}"

I believe is important to have a positive attitude because having a positive attitude can open doors to different phase in life. For example, when it comes to school, significant others and obstacles that life may throw at us. Is important to not loose our cool and have the type of attitude that everything is going to turn out great at the end of the day.

Having a positive attitude when it come to school can be a way to cope with all your assignments, teachers and schoolmates. Especially being a teenager people thing is not difficult to wake up every morning 6 or 7 AM and deal with people's attitude and also having to worry about the amount of work the teachers give out to students and then going home to do chorus is something that teenager are capable of doing, but adults don't take that time to think that they was teens back in the 60s where life isn't easy but when it comes to school rules have change. Now we must pass SOLs to graduate but, a person who stays positive believes in there self makes it easy for their self to get through what's stop you from being happy.

Everyone in life have to deal with different types of obstacles physically and mentally. For example when i came to America I thought my life was over learning a whole different language and also trying to adapt to whole new country a whole different environment would be hard for me. Instead of being hard head i stayed positive learn English really fast and started to start feeling more comfortable in America. I also was thinking of families back home and how i cant let them down, because they would love an opportunity like this to have a free education and being able to make it to the 12 grade. We all go through so much and the only way to get through is having a positive attitude that things well turn out better than yesterday.

Others would say that you dont have to have a positive attitude in life to be successful because they probably dont have self confidence, someone around to give them hope or have giving up on their self to many times. I believe that having a positive attitude is the key to being successful in life because you viewing life on a whole other level all you see is good things coming your way and the nothing can get in between of your dreams and if you was to fall you going to pick yourself right back up and start again.

In conclusion being able to wake up every morning and thank God for another day and pray that things are going to turn out better than yesterday is an important skill to have in this world we call life. We all have them phase that we go through and we feel like we cant keep moving forward but why stand in the same place with that same negative attitude is going to prevent you from wanting or doing more.

Sports is what most of people do play a sport but we always get frustrated when the opposite team scores a point so we try our hardest to score back the point. School is what a lot of humans struggle on its our work sheets and test but every question wrong we get it makes our brain smarter so do our best and not pick the wrong answer. Family is people we love and hang out with all the time but not very often we get into problems but every time we have a problem we just have to find a solution to do our best. This is why I agree what Duke Ellington said about a problem is a chance to do your best.

Sports is fun activity we can all do but most of the people do or watch but a lot of the player or fans. Start to become angry because their opponent scored a point but. The players can solve the problem and do their best to try to get the point back. When I was ten years old i played on a soccer league my team was losing to our rivals our coach told us the problem why they keep scoring on us. The team and I fixed the problem an tried our best trying to win back again and we did win. My brother plays basketball he used to be terrible at playing basketball he missed every shot but fixed the problem by practing more and tried his best. Most of the sports have a problem but they fix it.

School is a place where we make friend learn new subjects. For some people in school they struggle a lot on worksheets, test and quizzes. I used to struggle on test and quizzes but when i got the test or quiz back i studied on the questions i got wrong. So when next time I took the test i would get those questions right. So the problem i got wrong i tried my best to remember it so i would not forget it when i have the same questions on the test

Family are people we love and hang out with but sometimes we have problems with each other. When problems happen we try to fix our way and try our best to not have problems anymore. When I was younger I never wanted to share with my siblings. But i had to fix the problem and try my best to share with my siblings.

and it makes alot of sense.

and its possible for it to change.

my life was complicated at first, but I always thought of a solution to escape my problems, as when I was little my life was a living hell, I always got laugh at, even if I didn't had a reason to get laught at, so I saw through my life and thought theres was a reason to live anymore, but then I ask people about there life, and they told me everyone love them, and that hurt me very much, so I gave up and didn't ask anyone for help. until one day. one person in my class told me if I was okay, and I responded back saying, ''I want to end my life'' and he in tears, gave me hope and told me if I wanted to play soccer in his team, and I told him, I will think about it, and after the day pass, I became a new member of his team, I practice so hard, his coach saw in me potential and told me I should be the captain of the team, and it made me so happy, I started asking my parents to buy me stuff like food, and stuff I needed for traveling with the rest of my friends, so then the days pass through, and I woke up so bright, I couldn't wait to get ready to travel with my friends, so when I arrive to the school, I started practicing and getting ready to play for the team, then I saw behind me my team with a soccer ball, to get ready for traveling, when we started packing up, we saw this huge bus that was so cool, even a giant could ride in it, so we ran as fast as we could to the bus and I got the first seat in the bus, so my friends got jealous of me, and start throwing papers, but I was so happy I ignore the team and started thinking of the soccer championship, then waste my time fighting for nonsense.

the next day we all woke up and the bus stop us at a food shop, were they sell all kinds of stuff, and I was so sad, I forgot my money, but I didn't forget to carry my lunch, so we all finish eating and came back to the bus and travel again, and traveling we saw through the window amazing places, until we stop and ran out of gas, and stop at middle of the road, I was so mad, I scream very hard, and threw papers, until the teacher told me to calm down, he told we could instead have fun playing soccer at a private place, because it didn't matter if we didn't make it to the league, what matter to are teacher, is to put smile on are faces.",2.5,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.1120567,2.9528105,3.2366264,3.0719295,2.9009185,2.959343,3.4963975,2.9405959,3.4823167,3.48655,3.562669,2.6835728,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,503,6,0.4015904572564612,83.83333333333333,4,1,{'soccer'}
1703E46B4DC9,"People this days deal with a lot of issues . Its clear that sometimes adults also need help with making their own decisions. Most of the time we tend to think that because we're adults we are doing the right thing, but instead we're doing the opposite. Once you start to see the downfall,or the bad things that have started to happen to you or the people close to you because of the decisions that you made, its time for you to go for to seek for guidance. Its best that you seek help before you're life falls apart.

Guidance has helped a lot of people with their daily lives. The best part about it is that their's no age limit for when you can and can not go. For example high school students have the privilege to go for guidance at school anytime they need it. One important thing that high school students are given during guidance is to always pick the classes that will help them in the future. Going for guidance should begin at an early age. When you start going, you get to understand the aspect of life and the decisions that you make as you move on with you're life. Its a great place to go when you have no idea of what you're going to do with you life or how to make the right decisions.

The best part about going for guidance is that you are assured you'll be talking to an expert;meaning that they are able to control themselves in any situation and talk to you in any circumstance. Most of the people who hold these jobs have degrees and are licensed to do that work. For most people,talking to someone the do not know is easier that talking to someone who they know. In this case it's easier to open up to an expert who will soon give you advice and what to do next with you're life.

After all maybe guidance isn't a good place to go. One of the reasons that people don't seek for guidance is that it's too expensive. Most people can not afford to go for guidance every month or week. You need to have some form of income or at least be making a decent amount of money in order for you to afford it. The second reason would be, you're not really sure that the decisions that the experts make for you will be helpful. Its not always good to rely on what people say or when people tell you what to do with your life. In the end we are the ones who know ourselves better than anyone else does.

In conclusion most of us still need help with the decisions that we make. We all make good decisions and bad choices. As we grow we deal with so many things and sometimes its good to always talk with an expert. After all we're not perfect but the best decision for you is to seek guidance. You will be surprised by the outcomes of it.

25FA30699A04,"Should schools control students involvement in extracurricular activities, or should the decision regrading extracurricular involvement to left to students and their families? Students should decide on what extracurricular activities they will be interested in and discuss with their families because parents or guardians can support their decisions, they can be able to find their talents, and be able to get awesome scholarships or grades.

First students should decide on what activities they will be interested in because parents or guardians can support their children. Students will be absolutely be proud of their families by supporting them to do what they like, for example like sports. Teenagers are interested in activities because they like their own sports or the whole family likes sports. Students likes to get an approval from their families because they feel euphoria when their family accepts them. Teenagers also love when parents or guardians support them because they can have persuasive thoughts about the extracurricular activities.

Second students should decide on what activities they will be interested in because they can be able to find their talents. Coaches from different activities can see how good the students are and can see their special talents in them. Students are not perfectionist like god but instead they work really hard to show that teens can do it. Teenagers can also feel that they are talented because maybe it can be in their family tree lines. Students can figure out their talents by practicing everyday and be able to play like how professional do it. Also Teenagers will realize how to never give up on their activities. Finding their talents is an entertaining expression because people around the world can be amazed at how teenagers can be so good at extracurricular activities.

Third students should decide on what activities they will be interested in because they can get awesome scholarships or grades. Students can get scholarships by showing how much their activities mean to them. Teenagers get much better scores on their grades because they can be able to focus and stay healthy. It can be helpful for their college, their future, and their family status. Their coaches will be really proud of them by getting scholarships from different countries. Getting amazing grades and scholarships is the legendary epic passionate feeling that students will never forget in their lives.

Another point of view is many students do not like the school to control their activities. However, many people believe that school should have total control regarding extracurricular involvement of students after school because that think that school staff knows better and that they can guide students to get involve into more productive activities. Which would eventually result into a more bright and smart teens who would feel more comfortable to face the real world.

In conclusion deciding on the extracurricular activities they will be interested in will benefit their scholarships or grades, their families will support their children, and the students will find their true talents. So teenagers can become the 10 out of 10 in their best of the extracurricular activities. Also students can now decide and control their own extracurricular activities being able to become a legendary, passionate, euphoric, having awesome persuasive thoughts, and epic person.

A4CD4307D620,"Part of growing in this life is having the right type of mindset and skill you want for yourself only. The things I have learned in today's day is probably not really achievable because people give up to easy and think it's hard to fix cars. I like to build and take apart engines or even add parts to get more potential out of any car I purchase. I love to race cars and also flip my money too. That all takes skill but you don't learn if your not taught in life.

Likewise myself , for 11 years my father taught me how to use his tools and fix little things on any car he had at the moment. We would sell them and flip the money beacuse we'd be the ones fixing them up a bit. When I got my very first car it had no motor in it and bought it for six hundred dollars. I myself bought the motor for a thousand and installed the whole thing by myself but yet with the right tools it was then worth five thousand because of how many miles the engine was and how clean the interior and exterior was. I would always becareful though when it came to turbo the engines. You'd need to hook a special computer on it to tune the compter of the engine so it doesn't blow up on you. I'd love to race and compete against other peoples builds for money on the track. The best part of mastering this skill is that I will never need a mechanic to fix my own car again.

Another skill I have become really good at is gaming and playing the fracnchise called Call of duty. These types of games are shooter games and it all depends on how fast your sensitivity is and how fast you can react to whatever is happening in the game. When it comes to gaming I like to post videos online of how good I am because I can also get paid through how many people watch my videos. Some people like the entertainment but more like to see how fast the reactions I have. That type of skill has helped me so much in life because it has always helped me make the right decsions when I am driving on the road even in school it has helped me remember and react a little faster then others in class. This skill improves everyday because it's affected my everyday life. Through this I've mastered to actually get through everday life without having such stress because I am always prepared to react and decide what is good for me.

All in all I agree with Ralph Waldo he is right without trying something new you won't grow at all. The human brain is mean't to be expanded and stretched like a muscle to learn new things like playing a sport , remembering equations in physics and solving over and over again and still getting logical answers , to be good at something takes practice , but to master whatever you want to master takes brilliance.

I wanted to reach out to you Generic_Name to talk about what my interests are . The school I attend at is Generic_school and I am 17 Years of age. I want to learn how to start my own restaurant ,

know how you manage the prices , how to run the business , and also how to manage people.

However, I work at a restaurant at the moment and I am trying to become a manager. Although, I heard you have to do a lot before you become one . I want to know how to run the prices and how to make deals because I dont have that much experience , and must know how to do that to become a manager. Furthermore, I researched your job and read the reviews your customers love your restaurant . They say it is not to expensive but not too cheap ,also they say it is worth a drive down their. Thats why I wanted to ask to if i could get some experience from you.

Moreover, I wanted to know how to actually learn how to run the entire business. For instance, if i wanted to open up my own business I want knowledge from an expert before I do. My school does not have the right experience that you have . Also, I had spoke to one of my classmates they told me that you do training classes for students that are very interested in business she applied and she told me that she got really far in her business and that she is already getting started. I wanted to apply for the training so I have a clue on what is going on so I can eventually start my own restaurant.

Lastly, I wanted to know how to manage people around , know how to be a right trainer for a perfect restaurant. Nevertheless, people say it is hard opening up a business if you dont have the right training . For example, I had a friend that decided to run a business without experience she did not know how to mange the line in the kitchen , the people in the front, nor the prices. Later on the business ran out of service and got shut down. However, that is not how I want to end my career . I want to go somewhere and be in a place where people will love to socialize with the waiters, and to get their orders right .Thats an important part on why I came today to experience the way of training.

Based on this talk, I want to start my own business and work on becoming a better trainer . Even though, I have no experience with running my own business, managing the people, and how to manage the prices . I hope by the end of today I can get applied and start my training so I can get some ideas on how to do things around a restaurant and start my own business by 18 years of age.

130CA439835B,"I think is good idea, because the students have more opportunity to graduate early. some school districts offer programs the allow school, student to graduate in three years. most students follow this plan, must take courses during the summers,or in the evenings or may not be able to take electives course. but if you finish,

the school in three year you need to study very hard to pass all the class.

is good to finish the school early too because you go to the college early and you have more time find a good job. but you need bring more focus in one class but not in other because the graduation, can be going down. but they need break too because most students going to sleep during the class because they study in the night i would like to thank all, the teachers give homework and they not finish because they, dont have time to complete. what can they do during the night they need to get energy, to continue study for the class.

some students are very smart but other students work during the night and they dont have time to do the homework because they came tire for the work, and they dont focus in the class and they no pay attention to the class because some students came from other countries they need to pay house need get foot, clothes and other thing to school but, they need to learn English first because they need to pass all the class for enter in the college,

and they can get good jab to save the money for the future ,they can buy his own house, and get a family they need more important thing the education is very important because they look good person no body say bad thing of he.

I think is good idea because you focus only in one thing. then you can study , just in the school but if you trying to graduate for bettor life if you graduate your parents be happy. because you comply your goals if you have a dream follow you can comply, but you need to focus in the school dont slept during the class, did the homework get good grade dont forget you need to graduate in three years. must students who follow this plan must take courses during the break. to study for the exam you need to be ready for the college, thinking about you life what do you do when you out the school, you getting good job they dont know, yet because we are in the college ,but they have a dream to follow in the college the most important is you get good grade to graduate because if you get good grade they know you are good students.

my opinion is if `you graduate early you have more opportunities to grow up. very first because you are ready for the new life, you can find good opportunities,

but you need to focus in one goals first because you can get good opportunities, away because you graduate for the college ,and school o ready. they families will be happy for his becuase he get good result in the college.

Positive atitude is one of the basic rules that all employees follow such as a waeter or cashier. They learned it to win the customer and to get the business seccessful. When i worked in Krespy Kreem my manager tought me something which is a way to win the customer with a positive attitude that i have to follow. the service called ""the sweet"" service this word stand for smile,welcome,entice,engage,and thank. Having a positive attitude help you to beacame a friend and close to people and people will alwys feel confortable to talk to you. But having a negative attitude will make poeple fell unsafe around you and you will be lonely and not welcomed to the most of people.

Having a positive attitude also help you to be a teacher because you will always motivate your students and provide for them education. The reason why students skip classes is because of the teacher's attitude. students prefer the teacher who give a friendly smile. Positive attitude helps me alout to be an successful athlet because my coach is always happy from the way i act and my leadership that i do infront of my teamates. It makes me a respectful person and trustful guy.

In fact attitude is the way the person present his/her personality. People with a negative attitude are mostly asocial and introverts.

In my opinion having a positive attitude helps you to be a parent because the childrens get scared from the person who's always angry and frustrated. that's why most of the parents hide thier nerves and they act nicely infront of the child. Couple relationship consider attitude because most of momen prefer the guy with a positive view and who's open for evryone. The best way to live your life and be polite all the time is to have a positive attitude most poeple respect the person who give a smile and greet them. One of the importance of good attitude is bieng a family member. My uncle is the type of person who communicate and discuss with evryone and the way he talk is likeable from evryone because his always friendly and welcomed from poeple.

Politicians with positive attitude are always persuasive because they use communication skills to convince the audience by telling thier speech. Attitude is a way to find a job because when the person get an enterview with a manger he has to answer the question kindly and with a respectful way. One of the reasons of bieng a good student is acting with a positive attitude infront of my classmate.

I agree that a positive attitude is the key to success in life becuase its the way to live with poeple and find a job and create a family.

disagree with Duke Ellington because a problem could cause depression,lack of sleep, feeling bad. The meaning of problems is a chance for you to do you best is that problems help you do better.

Have you ever been through depression? Problems are bad because kids or even teens cannot control them . Next you need to stay away from conflict because conflict is problem and problem can be bad. After that depression is when you cannot yourself and you do wearied things like forget to eat or go to school. Another thing is depression happens when you are hurt and want to quit life. Also if you in depression talk to a trusted adult and he or she will help you.

Problems can also leave you to have some or no sleep. First that happens because your thinking about the problem and how can I get raid of it. Also you can raid of it doing something that you love to do like listen to something watch TV or even read a book. After that if it's a bad problem you will need to talk with a trusted adult. Another thing is that whatever it happens gust be calm and try to sleep and forget about it. In addition to that dont use your phone when your in that type of a problem and dont use phone before bed because you will be dreaming about it all night. At last have faith in yourself and dont give up in life because you can get raid of the problem and live a happy life, but dont forget to do something you like when your in a problem.

Don't feel bad when your in a problem because you can do it. First thing dont let other make fun of you being in a problem and gust try your best and you got it. Also feeling bad and looking at others could cause a bigger problem gust do your own thing. After that feeling bad abut something is not good gust be positive and worry about your self and dont let any boss you or making fun of you. Next problems could be bad but you need to talk to someone that your going through that and why are going through that. Then you can not feel bad and you will know what to d when you have a problem and hoe to slove it too. At last avoid any danger problem as much as you can.

In, concliontion I have come up with that what Duke Ellington is agreeable because some are long term problem and some short term, but there bad for your health and mental health and for you safety. Also you need to stay away from and type of dangers because dangers is like problem so stay away. After that tell a trusted adult when your going through something bad like conflict, dangers, and more.

0E03218FDD2F,"Educators say that students should have shorter breaks because, students don't retain information as easily when they return, its better if students spend more time in school rather than taking long breaks, summer breaks are better when they are shorter. Some students say having long breaks gives them time to relax and not having to worry about school for a couple of weeks is a good thing. One day on my summer break me and my friends were discussing on how much we love our long summer breaks. We also realized that having a long summer break is only fair because we spend so many hours in school everyday.

Summer breaks are better when they are shorter because, students dont forget as much information that they learned during school. Its better to come back and still remember the stuff you learned. Just imagine coming back after a 5 week break, I doubt students would be able to take a test right away. We need shorter breaks because if students spend to much time away from school they'll forget the important things they've learned. Students should consider spending more time in school rather than spending all there time on their breaks.

Spending more time in school is more important than spending longer weeks out of school not learning anything. Students must realize that their education is more important than spending time off of school. School teaches us what we need to know for the future, it prepares us for the next stage of life. They need to realize that they need to learn us much as they can, the more effort put into school work and learning the better the outcome. Life shows us that you can't just get a job without knowing anything, you can't sign up if you don't know your basic math or basic reading. Some students think school is a waste of time but honestly it's preparing us for the stuff we need to know.

Students do not retain information as easily when they return. Those long breaks really take a toll on the students, they return to school and don't have a clue on how to solve a basic problem. The more time students have out of school the more it drains their memory on what they've learned. Coming back on an empty brain not knowing anything isn't good at all because what if a student had an exam on the day he or she returned, do you think they'd pass? Having a shorter break would improve a lot of things.

In conclusion, it'd be so much better if breaks were shorter than they usually are. Students would be able to come back and easily answer a question and get it right. The less time on break the better, school should be the main priority for students. Im sure that some of the students would love to pass their classes. Overall we know that having a shorter break would improve the learning skill for all students. I agree that our breaks should be shorter so we could stay on track and keep p our good work.

The reason of that is because nowadays theirs youtube and most of the people have phones computers and TV's and so people can go learn stuff from phones,computers,and tv. And theres places that you can learn math too.

The reasons of why i think its fair for having shorter school time is because sometimes you learn something that you've learned already and in the other hand its just not fun anymore either i mean for some other kids they think its fun and some not. And also i've seen on twitter that they been hating on the guy who tells us if school is closed or not and people always hope that school is closed because no one is really looking foward to go to school on a monday and my opinion going to school on a monday is the worst and some other people might think the same as well.

Some celebreties became famouse for example Eminem who is a rapper he dropped out of highschool and he became famouse for something that he likes to do i would do the same if i didn't what to go to highschool but i wont because i have really good friends and all the years i've known them i just can't leave them like that.

I guess it just wont be fair y'know to leave someone you've known for awhile and just become famouse and while there in school working hard.

I guess we could all agree that we should have shorter school time because what if your doing something and you don't get to finish your project or something important you'll have to wait intill you get out of school and then come back and what if theres traffic and then you get home around 8:30 to 9:00. You wont have that much time to finish your project but if you live close to the school then i can't complain but i agree to this because like how i said we have phones,computers,and TV's and on the internet you could learn anything you want for an example you could learn about 10th grade stuff even though your an 8th grader maybe your interested in that.

My point here is that we should have shorter school time because nowadays we could learn by ourselfs and for the preschool kids and kindergarden kids they should stay there a little longer because they are toddlers and they can't learn anything by them selfs but for us we should i have shorter time in school hopefully you could understand. I don't want this to effect anyone but like it'll just make all the kids who go to school have more time when they have to do something important instead of coming home late and barely have anytime to finish there project or anything they need to do but thats my point of view.

It will be impossible to live happy with a negative attitude, but if you have a positive attitude everything is going to feel better. Having a positive attitude will help you succeed, have a good life, and higher emotions.

To succeed in life you will need to have a positive attitude. If you have a positive attitude you will succeed in life. Imagine having a job that you do not like, and you are thinking of looking for a better job, but you are not sure or you are having a negative attitude, those two things are going to keep you back from getting a better job. If you make goals in your life, and you want to accomplish all your goals you will need to start by having a positive attitude, for example you see a car that you really like, and you say it to your self I want the car or my goal is to one day be able to buy the car. You will start by putting more effort in your job to earn more money to get the car, and in all the process to get more money you will need to be positive or you will not get there.

Having a positive attitude is going to make you have a good life. If you have a good life you are going to have less stress and you are going to be healthy.

Having happiness in your life is very important because if you are not happy your are going to be depress and going through depression is a very difficult thing. Keep in mind that if you start having a positive attitude you will get through anything.

Finally higher emotions are going to help you stay strong and have a positive attitude. Positive attitude reflects in everything. If you have high emotions a lot of people are going to want to be around you mostly the people that have negative attitude or very low emotions because all they will want is to feel like you, they will want the good attitude. By having high emotions you can help a lot of people that are in a very bad place. Having high emotions will also help you create strong relations with other persons because you will understand how the others feel.

In conclusion, having a positive attitude will help you accomplish a lot in life it will make your life easier, and the other people arrow you. Positive attitude will help you succeed big in life you are going to have a lot of people arrow you because they will love the energy and the positive attitude that you have.

0D382343F3D7,"Why do curfews interfere with young people's lives? For some people, they have to stay at work really late because of this reason. A curfew could really mess up someones life when they're doing something important. No wonder why curfews interfere with young people's lives and here's the reason. Curfews interfere with young people's lives because they have to stay at work very late, have to intended to something , and have fun with their friends.

However, some people don't agree with this position. They think that a curfew keeps teenagers out of trouble. For example, When the teenager comes home on time, their mother wouldn't be scared where they have gone and why they stay out late. So, this explains why the council thinks that a curfew to young people's lives could get them out of trouble. However, young people still consider that having a curfew could interfere with their lives and here's the first reason.

Going home on time when they're at work is impossible. For example, some people working at a restaurant stay late some times because of cleaning the dirty dishes or taking a long time to do their side jobs. Also, when they're working for the government, they have to stay really late because of paper work or something urgent. This shows that having a curfew could make young people really stressed because they would have to rush their side jobs and get home in time. That is one good reason why they shouldn't adopt the curfew and here's the next one.

A lot of young people have things to do when they're out . For example, when the teenagers are in a play, they can't stop the play until it's finished or they will ruin the play. When they're at a school dance,they can't leave if they're participating the dance or they have a date. Young people sometimes have things to do after hours or want to go and participate. That's another good reason why the council shouldn't adopted the curfew and here's the last reason.

For teenagers, they just want to have fun and stay out late. For example, teenagers like to drive out very late with their friends or drink with them. Also, play games with their friends and stay up until they finish a level or a quest at a arcade or Dave and Busters. A lot of teenagers don't always sleep on time when they're having fun. That sums everything and here's the closing.

In conclusion, this stats that curfews interfere young people's lives because of them working very late. Also, when, they're intending in an event. Lastly, when they're having fun with their friends. This shows that curfews interfere with young people's lives. They can stay out as long as they like, it's their life.",4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.8147583,3.7480989,3.8880272,3.7627416,3.7421684,3.902869,3.5272038,3.6487556,3.8142703,3.761294,3.5875735,3.8618526,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,495,30,0.3333333333333333,16.5,5,9,"{'someones', 'curfews', 'intending', 'lastly', 'curfew', 'busters', 'teenager', 'arcade', 'stats'}"
FF190BD8380B,"My grandma always said, "" Is ok to fail, the only thing that matters is to stand up and keep trying."" A decision is the act of deciding something, as a controversy or question, by reaching a conclusion or making a judgment. If people take their own decisions, they are going to benefit. People should take their own decisions because it is a right, people can learn for the consequences of their actions, and people have the ability to think by themselves.

Many argue that people should visit a guidance to take decisions because guidance may have more experiences solving problems. However, they are wrong because in the past people fight and die for rights, and now that everyone have the privilege to talk for themselves they are not going to let others to decide for them. Clearly, people do not need to visit a guidance in order to made a good decision.

Initially, citizens have the right to take their own decision. For instance, Generic_Name, who is a citizen of the United States, wants to get the divorce because he found his wife cheating on him. To specify, he went to the court to get the paperwork done for the divorce. To detail, he have the right and the privilege to get the divorce because it is human right; he do not need the help of any guidance to made this decision because is something too personal. One should observe that taking decisions is a right that everyone is able to reach.

Additionally, people can make mistakes, but they have the capacity to emend them. For example, Generic_Name, for peer pressure, take a wrong decision about using drugs. To add, she realize that what she did were a wrong decision, and she understood that is bad for her health and she staunch doing it. Clearly, society can make people do what they do not want, but is in one to say: no; and fix what they did wrong.

Last, but not less important, everyone have different ideas and points of views, and because of that people should make their own decisions. For instance, Generic_Name's parents teach him to differentiate between good and bad; that means that he is not going to be in troubles for a bad decisions. To illustrate, he do not need the help of others to make a good choice. Obviously, humans are unique and sometimes people do not going to agree with others, but that does not means that one is wrong and the other is right; people need to respect others decisions.

In summary, taking decisions is a privilege that ancestors gave us, people are going to made mistakes in order to success, and everyone is qualify to talk by themselves. These prove that citizens should not need to see a guidance in order to made decisions. People must respect others points of views and do not judge them for what they do. There is only one choice: respect and always have present that no matter what others said you can do it!",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.689118,3.5352137,3.73951,3.5571375,3.3449955,3.6945379,3.6854167,3.3472624,4.143934,3.5105064,3.0996504,3.2621663,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,509,24,0.3909626719056974,21.20833333333333,3,5,"{'cheating', 'emend', 'differentiate', 'paperwork', 'staunch'}"
7CBB1B6F4E25,"Having electives classes can be a great opportunity to let students choose what they love to do and be lesss stressful. Schools, which do not have electives classes had become less popular. Students choose to study in schools that are less complicate for them. Although some say students should be required to take class in the arts actually, students classes should be electives because students can use the free time more helpful for their benifit and they will have less worries.

Those who believe students should be required to take class in the arts have their reasons. They believe students have to be more responsible and pass all their classes. They also think students can learn how to be good in arts.

One reason, why class in atrs should be electives is because students can use the free time more helpful for their benifit. For example, my friend Generic_Name he only had to take Algebra 2, English 12, U.S Goverment, and Chemistry to graduate this year. However, he had to take one class in the arts that was required to graduete. But, Generic_Name did not have more space during that day,

and the other day of school Generic_Name had to work to help his mother.

If Generic_Name did not have to take the class in arts. He will be able to graduate this year. In addition, he will not waste his time in one class that maybe will not be interesting for him. Also, he will be able to help his mother about taking care of his litter bother. When she was working, so his mother did not have to work less hours.

Another reason, why classes in school shoud be electives is because students will have less worries. For instance, my friend Generic_Name. One day she had to study for her History

ESOL. As well as, she had to make a big and beautiful draw for her class in art. Generic_Name took almost all the night making the draw ,so she did not have time to study and she fall the

ESOL. If Generic_Name did not have to make the draw for her art class. She will study for the ESOL, and she will get enough sleep. Generic_Name will be able to think and pass her test. And she will have more time to study. Sometimes taking a lot of classes is not a good idea for students bacuse it is to hard for them to concentrate.

To conclude, I believe that class in arts should be alectives becuase students will be more confident in doing what they love to do. Also respecting students opinions can be a great opportunity to demostrate them that school cares about what they feel. For those reasons I think class in arts should not be required. One is that students will use the free time more helpful for their benifit.

Another one is that students will have less worries. School have to see what their students need to make them capable and sucessful.

I mean wouldnt you have loved it if you had a chance to visit a office and learn a couple things get some tips from people that have been doing this job jobs for years. I think that everybody should get a chance to goo into the field of what you like before you even think about going in.

I think that I should have this opportunity to go visit to see what it is like learn a little from works that are doing this on a daily bases before I were get out of high school. For the reasons being I maybe not even really like it once I get out of high school after i do whatever it is to get to become a real estate agent what about if i dont love it anymore as much a I thought I possibly did back when i was in high school . I would obviously just be miserable doing something i dont even love also just wasting my time in getting all of this in place in order to get to where i wanna be and then not love it . Also If it isnt what i was expecting when i get a job in a agency it will be very dissapointinting to be working somewhere you feel like you have no choice and are unhappy with it. Thats one of the reasons I think it would get good thing for me to get a visit so i wouldnt have to go through all of that once I am getting ready to purse my employment.

Getting to visit would show me what the process is into becoming a agent, how to successes in the business not to crash and burn and to be able to become as successful as I can be in this journey . This work really interests me also because you make big bucks also seeing beautiful houses . I could maybe open even my own business of real estate agents also than Id be even making more money perhaps you could even show me how u became successful and got to be a manager of real estate agents. that would be very helpful you could show me how things work, steps you had to take to get in the passion that you are in. But in order for that to happen you know of course you would have to be open in letting me come in and learn from everybody gain knowledge from you hard working people how you are successful and all of that good stuff the ups and down everything .

That is why I think I should get the opportunity to visit and learn about real estate agents I could gain a lot of information from this visit it will help me in the future about my career how successful Ican become and all of that thank you for hearing me out I hope that you let me have this chance to learn and become a successful young girl in my future awaiting for me .",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0006328,2.8634286,3.1931596,3.0628781,2.8929274,2.8333724,2.9039884,3.398364,3.422437,3.7723994,3.749507,3.1636405,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,564,14,0.3634751773049645,40.285714285714285,7,4,"{'wan', 'goo', 'id', 'ups'}"
3F2941C11D95,"By extending the school day two hours, students and teachers will have more advantages to learn and to teach.

I agree to follow this model by extending the school day two hours. There are many reasons of why it will be better and will benefit us as students. One of the reasons is that we will have more time in the weekend to review our notes, homework, and things that we need help with. Another reason is that we will be doing the same forty hours of school even if we will have a four-day school week. It also will benefit teachers by increasing their time to review test or projects made by the students.

Most of the time there are things at school that we do not really understand, and a four-day school week will give us more time to study and review these things at home. We the students have the opportunity to go to school and graduate, but also some of us have obligations and responsibilities. For example in my personal life, I have to work after school everyday. And most of the time when I get home, I feel tired and I just go to sleep, I forget if I have homework or not. Therefore this model will give us more time to work and being less worry about going to school five-day week. We can concentrate at school four days and the other day we can work and do homework or projects when we have to.

Also a four-day school week will benefit us because we will be doing the same forty hours. Therefore our grades and education would not change. And I do not think that is necessary to study all five days, it is not about how many days do you go to school, is about how you take advantages from it. For example if you go to school everyday just to talk with your teammates, is like you were absent. For that reason I agree to extend the two hours of school, that way we can concentrate four days and having in mind that we will have three days to study or to keep learning at home.

Another reason of why I agree to extend the school day, is because it will benefit the teachers also. It will benefit the teachers by giving them more time to review and grade homework, projects or test that students took in the class. It also will give us the opportunity to spend more time with our families and people around us. For example, I work with my father in construction, and I almost do not see him all day until the night. This four-day school week, will give me the opportunity to spend a entire day working with him without being worry about the school for a day. And just like me, there is a lot of people who will be benefit from it.

Finally, school should be extended two hours day, that way we can have more time in the weekend to prepare for tests, teachers will have more time to grade them. And we will have three days to spend with our families.

101576652D3B,"The British naturalists and politician John Lubbock wrote, ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it. I agree with this statement because people should know how to make decisions themselves instead of relying on others to do it for us.

Although we are surrounded by people who influence us ever since we where young, people should choose their own character because people should make decisions by themselves more often. Everyone isn't the same, and we shouldn't always be taught to follow what we see everyone do. It's important that we make choices by ourselves because by doing so, it makes us stronger humans beings who can rely on ourselves and helps us gain self confidence and makes us rely on ourselves more often then we do.

Even though Influences help you know what's right from what's wrong, people should choose the person they want to because the people you know might be setting bad examples and you wouldn't even know that they're wrong because they told you it's right. For example, growing up, your guardians could be anyone. They could be good people, or they could be not so good people. It's our job to use common sense and decide for ourselves what's right and what's wrong. It's always good to use your brain and decide if something is morally right or wrong. If you see someone close to you being a bad influence, then one must learn to not replicate those actions, but instead make good decisions their selves.

Some might say that influences help if you're lost or confused in life, however, another reason why people should create their own character is because attempting something on your own and not succeeding helps you grow as a person. For example, if you just follow what everyone else is doing, you won't learn because thats the equivalent of you being spoon fed. If you dont attempt anything of your own, you won't know how to do anything by yourself. By always letting people make decisions for you, you won't be able to complete tasks on your own and makes you a less independent person. This is why making your own decisions is important. Not only does it help you grow as a person, but it also strengthens your mind.

In life, people often rely on others to build the person they are but in reality, it's better to rely on yourself instead of others to make decisions because it makes us rely on ourselves more often then we do, helps us avoid bad influences, helps you grow as a person, and strengthens our minds. All of these things are why we should all grow up by making our own choices and decisions instead of mindlessly do what everyone else does. People have all the power in their selves to be who they want to be. You're no one other than yourself after all, and that's the most important thing to think about when choosing our own character traits.",4.5,4.0,5.0,4.5,4.0,4.5,3.91156,3.9393559,4.078499,4.053567,4.056607,4.026965,3.9144118,4.224441,4.2528048,4.1926007,4.235302,4.5005426,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,520,21,0.3903846153846154,24.761904761904763,7,5,"{'replicate', 'mindlessly', 'wo', 'selves', 'naturalists'}"
5ADD410B9783,"A student does not need to be success to be praised, an achievement doesn't always necessary to have a self-esteeming come from effort failure and motivation,

First, success is not the only thing that can make a student be praise.

It is their effort whats matters even though a student did not do well on hes work, but a least he tried to do it, may be he is good at it, but he is have been a hard time on his life at that time, if a teacher or someone said good job you did it well i am proud of you. He is gonna be happy of that someone understand him at his bad time, and support him.

Second, failure is where a student achieve, learn, and gained experience, e never going to achieve at something without fail. Example, my on experience i have been seem achieve, and things that i did not succeed on it, in my life i had failed many school test or not get the score what i want to me it a fail, but to others it not, i always get mad at myself if i do not succeed at any tiny gold. When my teachers or someone tells me something nice, Good or they are proud at my work i felt so my proud of myself i am so proud that i have peoples who can understand me and support me. One day a teacher said "" i'm proud to have as my student and to be your teacher you had showed me that no matter what where you came from you can achieve anything you want, also in how hard you have worked maybe your work is no that good, but i had seeing you work harder keep being like this do not gave up on your dream or what you are doing ""

she praised me with all her words made me cried , and to keep going believe in myself that i can do everything.

Third motivation and self- confident, is what makes the difference, and changes a student life.

being confident on what we are doing on our life or working on something even if we don't give our best at least we tried it, sometimes we achieve in something and we don't learned any new thing because we already know hoe it is done it, if a person praise someone it motivates them to keep going and and not give up on their dreams even if its hard and impossible self-esteem makes a person fight back.

Finally, self-esteemed won't be always be for achievement, an self-esteem will be always on a student who are willing to do what is hard not the easy thing even though, they don't succeed and or achieve they know who they are and what they are able to do, lowers standard is better then nothing.

some people may think achievement are required to praise while others think that is not, and for this reasons it doesn't be necessary to be success or achieve a gold to be praised by someone.

The students would have to stay longer in the school and some would be mad and some be happy about it. And students that are bulllies would have a bigger chance on picking on people during the extended time of school. The next day the school would most likely be getting emails from students and parents complaining about the extended school day. While other students and parents wont care and go to school like a normal day and al lot more.

Also the jobs in the school could change like the teachers job and other jobs in the school time would be extended. Some teachers would complain by the extended school day if there gonna do a extended day everyday they are gonna have to be payed more or else the school would die slowly because all teachers,staff and other jobs in the school would quit and go work somewhere else better and get paid more. If one teacher does quit their job because of the extended time he/she would most likely tell other people that the school is terrible then the school would barely get people to work there and in a couple years later probably the school would be abandoned for other people to explore to see the leftovers of the dead school.

Finally the school would change by alot than before it ever has in its couple years of existance. The school would have to face a lot of consequnces like a lot of students posting on the internet about how the school is trash,boring and now they want to go to a different school. And the teachers would complain about if they are going to teach more than ever they want to get bad even more money. And they would have to change the whole school time of the day,the bus time and the students classes time which would took a very long time to do. Either way other jobs in the school would be more difficult than ever for example janitors,staff and teachers.

Even though the school really does want to change original time to a extended time it's not the smartest idea in the world because theres gonna end up being consequnces to it and they are not going to be fun for anyone. Either way next thing you know the county that owns the school will just die because of the extended day. Because then who knows probably no one then later on wants to go the either school in the county anymore and would probably just moved out to go to a better school. So this is why this idea is a bad idea.

5EE526AB840B,"How can a students learn more from home than attend classes in school?. A student has more benefits if they attend to classes in schools because if the student can not understand a topic or has questions about it, the teacher can not explain by video conferencing as a teacher that can explain face to face an be sure that student understood. My second reason is a student does not have a person who trust or a person to appeal if He/She are passing for any personal or familiar problem. In schools We can find a lot of person as a teachers, counselor, police members, and psychologist to help students. My last reason is a student has to socialize with other students to be prepare for his/her future.

Firstly, if a student can not understand a topic and has questions about it, they can feel more comfortable to ask and said

""I do not understand, can You explain me again?, if they are with the teacher face to face. Generic_Name (My friend's name) decided to take the classes online, in the beginning He was so excited, but after one month He told me that was not a good choice because He does not feel comfortable asking a lot of question about one topic by the computer, and when He not understood something, He just do not said anything to the tacher who is given him classes by video conferencing.

Secondly, in schools we can find many ways to be help if we have any problem in home. Teachers, counselors, any person who works in the school can help us. In my junior year I had a classmate who was attending to the school but then she change her classes to online, When I ask her why she change her classes She told me that her mom was fired of her job and She had to start working to support her family. She was 16 when that happened she felt alone with nobody who help her.

Lastly, students has to socialize with other students to feel the sensation of surpassing. If they just does not want to attend school because they are shy or they does not like to interact with other students, We are not educating a good citizen. Students has to feel the sensation of surpassing when they do their homework or when He/She finished their assignments, that sensation the student can not lose. I read in a newspaper a case about Generic_Name, He was 16 when He attended to online classes, He never like attend to school when He discover the option for students to attend classes from home he decided take it. because He never like to interact with other students. After 2 years he graduated, but he never were prepare to socialized with persons, and that affects his personal life.

In conclusion, the offer to learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing in not a good idea because all of them are under 18, They does not have a good criteria to take that big decision that can bring serious consequences or affect their life.",4.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.1572819,2.9471164,3.219843,3.0210855,2.8027058,3.042511,3.254916,3.5947185,3.5773275,3.1476247,3.0632548,3.4700942,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,531,18,0.3804143126177024,29.5,5,17,"{'mom', 'surpassing', 'socialized', 'conferencing', '16', 'lastly', 'classmate', '18', 'interact', 'counselors', 'video', 'socialize', 'online', 'educating', 'homework', 'firstly', '2'}"

There are many reasons for explain that takes classes from home is a good idea, this are some of them:

First, the students that take class at home don't need to leave from home, nothing can detain take classes. The weather changes don't affect to take a class, if is snowing, raining or are a hurricane in the city.

The parents of the students that take class from home can be more unsuspecting, because they sons are in home, also this is benefit for the parents of students that take classes from home; they can be sure that nothing danger can be happen to they sons. The student don't have any excuses for be absent. This is good for the students because they at final a year has perfect attendance.

Second, the students that take class at home just can be absent, if they need to stay in home and don't take some class, they have the opportunity to explain to the teacher by text or just a call, then the teachers need to ask to your parents if is necessary don't take classes because you don't feels good. The students that take a regular classes in the schools can't do this because they need to be in the school everyday , if not in this case the correspondent sub school has the obligation to put absent in the class day.

Finally, the students that take class at home can't missing a class, they don't have the possibility to missing the bus or miss some useful for the school. The students can't forget the computer, pencil, notebook or other things that we use in school, because they have all classes online, this can be positive for the students that stay in home at care to they parents the student can't has some distractions that sometimes has in the school, like talk with any friend, use a inappropriate language to the teacher or don't pay attention, if can be some possibility to the student miss some class; they can take the missing class latter.

In conclusion, take a classes from home is a good choice because stay in home, do not have any absent if are sick, and don't missing class, are a good idea for take classes at home, the benefits that this have are good for parents and students that need to have more family time, or need to have more time with they sons. A reason that take classes in the schools take a big part time of students, this is a good choice because the students don't need go to the school just stay in home ,add that, this is a good choice for some students that need to stay in home, with they brothers or they parents.",4.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,2.937263,2.7188063,3.0233247,2.7674823,2.5499916,2.8505974,3.8433383,2.8752801,3.0391936,3.0851576,2.6175985,3.0706167,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,525,13,0.2647619047619047,40.38461538461539,2,6,"{'detain', 'excuses', 'notebook', 'online', 'distractions', 'unsuspecting'}"
EB1500B8EA75,"Some students who live far away from their schools; they prefer to attend classes from their home instead of going to a school, attending classes from their home can affect some students education and affect their live in a future beacuse not all of the students who are taking online classes are going to complete their work .In my opinion I think is a bad idea to attend classes from your home because students can get distracted for anything, not complete their work and get bad grades.

If we have online class it can be hard to these people who got distracted for anything .Once I had a friend her name was Generic_Name, and she had a online math class that she needed to be able to graduated. One day I went to her home like at 6:00 pm after shool and she was working in her online class, but honestly Generic_Name was not really woking in what she suppose to be working on, yes she had her cumputer on and her online class open , but she was getting distracted by the her tv show just because she like the beaty and the best she stop doing her work. My friend Generic_Name she suppose to do her work but she always got distarcted by her tv show, if she had deside to turned off her tv she didn't got distarcted by anything and she could be success in her online class.

Students who attend classes from their home as there is anyone who is reminding them to completen the work some of them forgot to get it done and they had an incomplete work. This year I am taking an online class and sometimes I forget that I have to be doing all my requested assingments, and by the end of last week I got a bad score because i didn't complete my Vocabulary assingment. If I had put a alarm every day to remind me that i have tostudy and complete my asssiments i could get a better score.

Some others will say that attending classes from home can be a good idea because they can work on in any time,however,others may say that is a bad idea beacuse they can get bad grades. Some classmate that are taking online classes they aren't reading all the directions that the class is giving ;they are just doing the work without reading and that can affect their grades. Having bad grades can made you to not pass your school year, but if we efort we can be great.

For some students is consider to take online classes, but in some point can affect them in their education. There are many students who have online classes and they are falling because they dont have enough help, and some of they because they are not doing it .If schools provide after schools help for online classes will be helpful for all student who needed to be more success, and feel more confortable while they are doing their work and also teachers to be cheking if students are able to pass.

Most part of the poblation is happy because they success in life and catch up all the goals. A high percentage of poblation get stuck in their preoccupations and they can't see the light of the sun; they think that life hate them. The poblation should take a positive attitude because is the key to success in life, and the people feel free of stress and preoccupation.

The scientist studies show us that a positive attitude help in life. A bunch part universities pass a lot of time doing research for understand the human mind and their attitudes. If you watch the news, news paper or internet they share with you all the discovery, of course that the information is shared with the authorization of the universities. The people think when universities discover something huge or important of the human body is a big step for a man, because a human body in a secret box.

The poblation is happy because they success in life. The major part of poblation think that when you have a positive mind the stress is lower and the output is higher. The brain probably is not a huge muscle but, if you use to a positive form all your body respond because all your body is connected with your brain. For this reason people give you this tip for a good style of live and a good success to.

On other hand a high percent get stuck in life. These part of poblation is the minimum part that say that life is hard and not every thing is easy because you need put afford. Even if you have a positive attitude they say that life sucks and is hard get the thing that you need or dream. But for this people is; more hard you tried to get a positive attitude it's impossible, sometimes you fall through in life and then you give up and dont tries more.

Here is a example of positive attitude: When you have a test and you are so nervous, but you think on you mind that you can do it because you're totally sure that you remember the classes and the topics that you teacher teach in class. With a positive attitude you can do a lot of thing for most difficult that it's look. For this reason the human brain is totally amazing bacause you discover a lot of capacity for doing things that you think that you can't do it.

In short, if you want success in life think positive for most difficult that show up you can do it. The human body have a big capacity for doing change to their self, and if you thing negative is time that you change your mind and start thinking positive. Also if you think more positive than negative you health get better you must have a healthy mind and body, also when you talk with other person you can transmit your positive environment or they can feeling easily, so be positive.

A8BB150F53AB,"In my oppion, I think technologly is good for the world! Because you can comunicate with people that are far away. Even it's a great way to help you with school like homework, studying and learning also it makes teachers life easier. And I think people would get lost around the world if teachnologly wasn't made. Because GPS helps you to get to your destenation safely also it tells you where you at. Teachnologly is probably the best thing people will carry around them because all your messages, calls and emails comes threw your phone. When I got my first video game, I started playing it 24/7 because I use to play it with my friends during summer break. But one day I knew video games wasn't going to be a big thing anymore so I asked my parents if I could get a phone and they said "" yes I will buy it to you if you bring me good grades the next marking period"". When I got my first phone I started using it to text friends and being in soical media and I know that wasn't going to get me anywhere in life. But one day I thought to myself what if technologly can help you with everything like now adays? Because my computer helps me with homeworks and projects and I can turn it in on time.

Although, some people think technologly is bad because it keeps you out from playing sports, going out with your friends and communicating with people!

Some people don't buy their childrens a phone because they want them to work for it, but some parents aren't like that. People be going on soical media putting there own life at risk, that's why some parents don't let their own child have technologly. Also because people be using it all the time and they don't care whats happens around them. Like my parents didn't want me to have technologly when I was little because he wanted me to open to the world. But I was shy to talk to new people that I didn't even know, I started to be helpful and friendly to everyone because I knew some people didn't have the samething as me. Because some countries are really poor and they don't have money to eat and they can't help out their children with their eduaction.

In fact, I think technologly is always going to be helpful where ever you go, because if you go somewhere that people don't speak your language you'll have your phone on you and you can research there language and it will tell you. I really will not know if technologly was not made because it helps everyone in the world right now. It helps me pay my payments and learn online. So I think technologly is a good way to help you with things and to communicate with people that don't live with you.

Families can do different types of activities outdoors. Going to the state fair is something all families or friends can do that is fun. Another way of enjoying outdoors is going camping with your family.

Spending more time with your family outdoors can be fun and productive. People can go hiking with other people. Hiking is an outdoor activity that you can walk. When your like stress you can walk and listen to the beautiful birds chirping.

Like for an example, fishing, hiking, going to the beach, doing cookouts, and going to the park is an activity. Everybody would be occupied, and would have so much excitement in what they are doing. For an example, last summer I went to Pocohuntus State Park with my family. We went on a tour around the whole park. As we were walking, we had seen a building. We had entered the building, and inside it was a mini zoo. The mini zoo was filled with all different types of animal. There was animals that wasn't from Virginia, and brought it from another state. I would love to go back with my family this summer again.

Going to the state fair has a lot of options for you to do. Like for an example it has games, and roller coasters and more variety of games to play. The state fair is a really fun place. For instance, I went to the state fair last year with my cousin. The state fair was full of people and enjoyment. Their was a lot of games, roller coasters, a mini farm, there was a concert, a lot of food courts, and horse racing. That day was a really productive day because we had to walk from station to station. I rode a roller coaster called the ""Dome"" it was really scary and it kept spinning upside down, sideways from left to right. This is a good outdoor activity to do with families or friends.

Another way to enjoy outdoors is to go camping with your family. You can play games, do campfire, and make moores while you are in the outdoors. For example, when I was 8 years old I went camping with my family. I remember that day it was so cold. I slept in the back in the trunk with my cousins, and then I transferred to the passenger seat because it was so cold. The next morning everybody woke up and then after we took a walk around the lakes. Afterwards everybody packed their stuff and headed back home.

All of these are examples of doing outdoors activity with your family . Spending time outdoors with your family like hiking, going to the state fair, and going camping is fun and everybody will enjoy their day. Everybody should at least do one of these activities outdoors, so you can feel relief from everything you have in mind. Having fun at these places would want you to go back again                  ",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.8041515,3.7543788,3.8962457,3.8075438,3.822259,3.821458,3.7194722,3.5332289,3.4481213,3.1198776,3.411163,3.544763,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,524,38,0.4026717557251908,13.789473684210526,5,12,"{'sideways', 'chirping', 'mini', 'options', 'cookouts', 'coaster', 'campfire', 'scary', 'roller', 'coasters', 'hiking', '8'}"
DDB673D3627D,"Who wants to work alone by themselves when you have the chance to work together with a group of students in your class. Working together is more beneficial because with a group you can get all the work done more faster and students are less worried. Many students should work together as a team in school because it helps them with good life skills life. People might need this to help them when working at a job in the future. I agree that working with a group is more efficient and help students learn more better. Benefits of working with a group is more beneficial because allows students to collaborate, allows different ideas or opinions from peers, and allows each individual to have feedback from peers.

However not everyone would agree with this position. Some people believe that benefits of working alone is more helpful for themselves. For example, when a students is working on the computer for a certain projects in fashion marketing, fitness and foods or other subjects in school because they're able to finished it themselves. This explains that people can put their own ideas and will get the work done more quicker without any help from peers during class. Nevertheless the oppositions over looks other important points.

First reason is that student can collaborate with other peers but only about 30% of people work together with other people on school projects assignments or activates. For example, in classrooms students have more possible chances to separate the task with each other. Also people would't have to worried about not getting each slides done because their peers would be there to support them. This shows that students who work together with peers they are not only benefiting themselves but helping other people too. Students can enjoy and have fun working with friends also everyone will get a good grade.

Second reason is students can come together as a team by listening and hearing out all of their peers creative ideas and opinions in a group on the project. For example, each person might have a good suggestion or reason on a history project that will help their group with the assignment. This shows a person will have many ideas that they can chose from a peer in their group and it's always nice to use different reasons from a student.

Third reason is when a student can get a individuals feedback to help them on a english writing essay in class. For example, the person is writing a essay for class on Google docs with each other it helps them talk and get feedback from a peer or friend in class. This shows that having a students help is important because you can fix the error in the essay with a peers correction and students can learn more better together from people.

To conclude that working with a group is more better for people because allows students to collaborate with peers so that people can separate the task with each other, allows different ideas or opinions from peers when each person has good suggestions for projects and allows individuals to get feedback from peers on helping a students with a english writing essay. Maybe good for students to work alone but working in a group is helpful to have someone support them.

C4A874260D21,"Most students enjoy summer vacation, but some educators feel that the summer break is too long and when they return in the fall, they become more lazy and they can't retain information as easily when they were in school.

Summer break is the only long break that the school gave to the students to do all the things that they couldn't do during the school year and they can rest for a long preiod. I don't agree for these reasons:

First, A lot of students wants to work during the school year or do other things that take more time to do, but they can't do it because they got too much homework or they need to study for a tests that they have that week and they just had time for that. So in Summer break they got 3 months so they can work and do more things that they couldn't do during the school year. Students can work and have more experiences that can help them when they want to apply for another work that is much better for them and learn more things.

Next, Students needs a break after the school year. Most of the students get stressed for all the works and tests the teachers gave to them, their brains needs to relax and rest for a preiod time because it's not good to be always working, they got tired too. So Summer break is the best period to relax and distract for a period time. Students can go to the beach and have fun, Enjoy more time with their famillys, hang out with their friends, go visit new places, too much things they can do in this break and the weather is perfect too.

Finally, In Summer break the students don't worry about works or tests they may have need to present when the break is end. When they have Fall, Winter or Spring break the school gave to them just one week and in that week most of the teachers gave to the students works and tests they need to make after the week breaks, so in conclusion they don't have breaks because they need to study or do works that the school gave to the students. In Summer they don't need to worry about that and enjoy the time they got.

Some persons may don't agree with me because they think that have more breaks during the school year is better for students, but they need to know that the students got works during that breaks and they need to study for tests that they need to make after the week break, so in summary, they don't got that time to relax and give a time period to their brains so they can rest.

In conclusion, Summer break is the only long period that the students got to relax and they can do so many things that they couldn't do during the school year because of all the works they got and test that they need to study for. So Summer break needs to stay like that and is the best season for students so they can enjoy and have fun in their long break.",4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.4816673,3.2987952,3.5148978,3.353252,3.215227,3.4515016,2.579887,2.2914715,2.8154292,2.2536697,2.180769,2.534234,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,544,15,0.2738970588235294,36.266666666666666,5,3,"{'homework', 'distract', '3'}"

Currently your accomplishments, acts, and attitude speak of you and how great you are, around the world many of the people think do something else is a act of a humble person for example: on your career, your area of work, in the school you do something it's not your responsibility,the people gesture the big heart has and how important it is show to the world you trying make something else to dial the different. I am agrees because when being yourself the people see something special on you and try to be a person you like to learn new things maybe in the first try thats no gonna be perfect but you never give up to be different around a lot of person. three reasons for being yourself is important: first other persons gonna be like you, second you gonna be inspiration for everyone, third your accomplishments can change the mentality of many people around you.

First being yourself is important because other person they gonna be like you, in a situation like you always do the extra mile, is when you help other no matter it's no your job example: in the school you explain to your friend how resolve any equation of math but is not your job in the class, because you are only a student and it is the teacher responsibility of the teacher explain to your friend, and the accomplishment many person they gonna be like you

Second being yourself is important because you gonna be inspiration for everyone, in many area like in your house, neighborhood, school, college, including church. For example: if you neighbor look it you clean you yard or your house or helping others neighbors, like cut the grass and help each other you can be motivation for other person, thats how complete your accomplishment of be inspiration for other person.

Last being yourself is important because your accomplishment can change the mentality of others, than the people see it your progressive on your life doing thing the other people ask them self, how they did it?, you can leave a massage and tell them how you did it , and if you did it they can do it too. For example: in the family always we can see different type of family, one they have job but with lower salary, and one with their own company, if we are the type of person like to help your own family you gonna transmit that like good vibes, hope, etc.

In conclusion, like the author said is constantly we like a humans trying to do extra things to have a great result and accomplishment in the life, and more then 50 percent of the world do that because the majory of the person see the benefits of help to others, and the most important the world see a positive side of this massege that the author said always do something else and our greatest accomplishment can be example for another person around of us because more than example we can be inspiration for many people in the world.",2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.7409177,2.5471706,2.920202,2.690052,2.4009056,2.6070495,2.8095696,2.6956878,3.1311092,2.4778912,2.4832454,2.2230356,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,550,9,0.34,61.11111111111112,10,6,"{'vibes', 'transmit', '50', 'massage', 'mentality', 'dial'}"
F45967CEFA55,"Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill stated a quote that said, ""success consists of going from failure to failure with out loss."" There are 3 reasons why I agree with this statement. The first reason is, failing will want to make you push for a success, the second reason being that you'll have more of enthusiasm when you're find more ways to succesed, and the third reason is achiving for higher goals.

I agree strongly with this prompt and Winston Chruchill's quote, yet some people think it's something at may not be true and think less of them self. In the first paragraph I will explain my first reasoning with a strong example of it.

First, reasoning to this prompt would be, falling will want to make you push for success. Even though not many people think that is the way that many of our past inventors had learned. Albert Enstine was one of the smartest people out there, yet he had come face to face with failure many times in his life. The only way he learned was to try many other different ways to solve his problems. He used failure as an insperation to to keep trying like our first inventor of the light blub. Even though many people found it frusterated and diffivult when they've failed, which pushes on to my second reasoning.

Next, the reason would be that many people think different about them selfs when they fail in something. Thomas Edison thought different, even though he had failed 100 times, he had not gave up. When he finally successed, he said a quote that is in my mind till today in this presnet day. That quote was ""I didn't fail 100 times, I found 100 ways that it didn't work."" Even though, Thomas Edison had failed he maintaned him self with a lot of enthusiasm, Failure is never an option, but finding a solution to it is a success.

Finally, the last and final reason is achiving for high goals that you want to reach. It don't matter what others may think of it or if you'll be able to achive or not. Show them that they are wrong even if you come to a failure don't stop, find a solution and fix it to make it better than before. You'll reach higher goals with higher potential then what you'll ever imagine. Then later on you will be able to do anything you put your mind to and demonstrate your knowlage to the world.

In conclusion, doubting yourself is not how you achive your success. Finding a way to solve it is achive your success. Get the insperation from the people who had once been in your spot and they done to successed to there goal. Even if failure is a role in life to find success it's the only way youll reach it. Failure is only a motivation to get you to successed.",4.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.2690592,3.1746657,3.3937385,3.2742944,3.0671744,3.1163235,3.951549,3.2765932,3.467434,3.5611358,3.454261,2.8549151,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,502,26,0.4302788844621514,19.307692307692307,25,6,"{'doubting', '3', 'pushes', 'smartest', 'blub', '100'}"
06F5F6A09DC6,"More than one person's advice

Have you ever wondered or questioned yourself why do you have to ask more than one person's for advice? Yep you heard me. People from all around the world ask advice about anything. That could be video games, schools, and even Life. Obviously, there are many other things to ask advice. It's kind of asking for help, you can say. People incuding kids, teens, and even adults are asking advice that could help them in the furture, you guys even might have connections, and more than one person. More than one is better than just asking for one person's advice.

Having connections

The people you ask for advice were kids too just like you and they possibly ran into what you are stuck or struggling at right now. I recommand you to ask adults more than anyone else. That's either with struggles at school, home, family members, or even life. I almost forgot to include decisions because small decisions can eventually become big decisions. I recommand you to ask adults more than anyone else. I mean you can ask seniors but they most likely will forget everything since they were kids. The worst thing you can do is asking someone young even a 18 year old adult because you never know what happened in them. Trust and worthy friends you can ask but friends that you just say hi to once a day or even a week wouldn't be so great.

Help in the future

Advices not just help from the presents but in the future as well. According to my calculations you could use that advice over and over again. For example, let's say you didn't know where you put a comma in a sentence, therefore, you used a person's advice and it was to put a and where ever you were going to put the comma at. You can also use it to help your kids and even grandsons if you still remember.

More than one person's advice

Last but not least, why more than one person's advice you ask. One advice can help and even solve whatever you have in mind but you actually want to check if they were right. You probably want to gather the information and rethink it. Everyone in my opinion should at most ask two people for advice just to make sure. First person person wasn't being that specific enough so you decide to go to another person. If they haven't been specific enough then just go to another person. I mean how hard is that? Especially kids since they have just started growing up and will soon become young adults.

Everybody should be struggling something in a certain time of life that they ask for advice. Don't be shy for asking advice and you believe in yourself that you are a brave and confedent man that doesn't need help. Because really you will be a better one for asking advice. Therefore, the reason that we ask advice is to become someone better each day by taking that advice.",4.0,4.0,3.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,3.4565148,3.316373,3.5580683,3.4229617,3.2817197,3.3925319,3.5982919,3.3472,3.5486214,3.5807645,3.6217246,3.252575,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,527,32,0.4269449715370019,16.46875,6,9,"{'struggles', '18', 'seniors', 'video', 'comma', 'rethink', 'yep', 'grandsons', 'advices'}"
DF149975C610,"I agree with emerson's statement. I will grow every day, I do best in life. When I wake up most days, I think on my goals. I will reach my dream in my school to grow better in Algebra. I will grow in my school , to improve my english. to set up my plan to become a doctor. I study hard every day. I can do this finish my goals. I work hard. I feel tired most all the time , but that is not my stop sing to leave my school. I will finish finish as soon is possible I will be satisfied getting my goals done.

I disagree we don't have to challenge other person's to do better. Some people they are satisfied what they have,for example job,school, and other activities. may be they still in high school and they are no ready to go to the next level to go the college.

In my case, I want more challenge on me to have a better job, better opportunities, to support my family. Majority of people think, I can't complete my studies or finish my school. I believe on me, I will grow up to see my self in a good job, I will grow in Math, english and History. I believe also some people, are happy what they have in life. Further they will discover new ideas, to put in order to bring on their future plans to move on to the next activity or achivement.

People grow evendough, when they have done journey in life to achieve their goals. I saw some students today. They were my classmate in the same school where I done too, now present day some of them are lawyers, profesors, and doctors. Solutions I agree we should learn new things in life, is important to have wisdom to share. I agree I can get my High School Diploma.

I will motivated people to back school to done education. To do progress in life, we do have to find the excited things what should like to do. If we are good in soccer, let's go play soccer. if we like music, we should find the ways how to learn to sing. I agree I'm the solution to get things done one of them my education. I disagree I am no the problem to stop my goals.

Finally with effort one day, I can be a doctor. I know is no goig to be easy. I love dificult things on me to get my dream to become thrue.

satisfied is a word I will declined, I will see my self with my family, friends, and teachers given me my diploma. I respect people, is satisfied with their goals.

In my opinion, if we have the opportunity to have a better future. We do have to challenge our soul. To become a such a profesional to help our world.

I think that If you have a positive attitude you wont get in trouble because the attitude that you give out is the way that people judge you, A positive attitude is a great way to get the things you want in life like for example, If you want to get a job or a career you have to have a good and positive attitude because if not then they will not accept you like for another example if you have a positive attitude you can make friends and people will like you because of the way you are if your kind people will be like ""wow this person is so nice and kind"" i just think that being kind and nice is the best way to be in life you dont really get in trouble because your attitudes nice and not rude and about things that people tell you or want you to do in the other hand if your rude and people people will look and you and think about you in a rude way and not like you. The reasons I feel like a positive attitude is good because i am a kind person and dont get in to trouble with none because there is no reason to be mad and angry about small stuff. I fell like other people might think different about what I think because we all think different about everything. If you go to a friends house and you be all mean and rude and all dirty people are not going to like you because of the way you are and the other hand if you are all nice people they will like you because of how you are you and that you have respect of how your attitude is if not then you will not be wanted by people because of you act and are and people who act all rude end up in places they never thought they would end up in i just saying just stay with a positive attitude in the world and you will succeed in life and be great and not have to go through stuff like get in to fights or locked up in jail. I meant i know some people that have bad attitude and life and they are doing great in life but there is going to be one day that you will get in a problem by the way you act i think that just stay with a positive attitude so you dont got to worry about anythings and that its just better way to get al the things you need and would like to active in life because why be all rude when you can just be sweet and caring then be all grumpy and mad about small little things that can be fixed because thats what I think but if you have a bad attitude you might like end up saying or doing something that you will regret like if your like taking and with a attitude you might end up saying stuff that you dont mean and if your normal and calm about stuff you dont go to worry about nothing.

BFCE7D755436,"Do you think should student to use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes ?

A lot of young people has cell phones that can use for many ways. The young people use their cell phones for text with their family or do their homework, but Today's many kids are going away from people. However, they use the cell phone in bad ways in classroom, so, I believe students should not use the cell phones in class because they could cheat in their exams and get easy score.

The first reason , when the teacher says, ""get out the phone, we are going to start study in our phone"". The students does not care when the teacher is giving the instructions of the topic. A lot of students are going to playing games or listening music and when the teacher ask question about of the topic they would say, ""i do not know' and every body starts to laugh because they were not paying attention in the classroom and their grades is going down.

The second reason,Today's in the world student only put their face in the cell phones. A lot of student use the cell phone for their social media in classes, therefore, Student are not paying attention in class when the teacher is explaining the topic. However, student when the cell phone is allowed to use, they will have more focus in their social media than classes. For example, A lot of student have the famous ""snapchat"" that it is film videos for ten seconds and share in your story for people see them, Student with their cell phones are going to put any video in their story to showing the teacher talking or everybody laughing.

Another reason and is the most important, Student cheat in exams with their cell phones because the teacher says, ""you can use your cell phones in this test"". however, students do not study for any home work or test. they can get a easy score. For example, they know can use the cell phones in test, but this time the teacher says, ""you cannot use the cell phones in this test."" The student are going to get bad scores because they thought that can use the cell phone to get a great score. however, a lot student do not study for any test when they can use the cell phone.

However, The propose of the teacher is that student earn easy information and good scores. The allowed to use the phone has a good way that students can search homework or read a book. Sometimes the teacher gives homework to do at home and you will use your cell phone for solve the homework. For example, students are learning other language and do not know some word in the information gave the teacher, they can use the translate to know the word.

In conclusion, Students should not allowed to use the cell phones in classrom because they are not going to learn anything at the final of year. Allowed to use the cell phone is a disadvantage for students in the futures in their jobs because they were always in their cell phone playing or social media.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.1938686,2.9882934,3.2484326,3.0134015,2.8106923,3.0713618,3.9947827,3.4151864,3.822521,3.2147996,3.431745,3.1530237,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,538,23,0.328996282527881,23.39130434782609,3,7,"{'exams', 'video', 'futures', 'cheat', 'homework', 'videos', 'disadvantage'}"

If I wanted to learned; I would stayed at school or watch a video to how to English, biology, or what classes do I chose from. But online or video conferencing are very different. online can be probably a website, YouTube, (Example like be able watch how to do math) or other. video conferencing is probably like a chat room or some video live.

Online is a great way to learn because I use on homework, essay, Google, YouTube, and other website. And here an of example. If I wanted how make a cake and when I used online website. It bring the website how to bake a cake. And there simple as that. But sometime if I ever get like a hard assignment and I checked it online, and it gave me the wrong answer, then sometimes the website can't be everything right. But I go ahead and tried other website to see if there a correct answered.

Now let say that I had to studied a lion. I can go online to checked in Google and it bring me to whole bunch of website, and click one of those website to see if there a way to studied some lion or go to YubeTube to watch how scientist studied theses creatures.

Video conference is probably like talking to a teacher or maybe live chat. And the way I think of the video conferencing is not to bad. It like you're teacher or someone is teaching you, and its like simpler to school. If I wanted to do it, like if there a problem that I need to fix then I go to video conference so they can helped me and the question. But I think its a great idea to do it.

The way I see is online is a helpful and video conference is helpful too. But I think it like home school staying at home and studied online or video conference. So my reasons is it a way to learned fast, getting good grades, or other information that you need for the future. And here a other reason why to use online or video conference. Online is been update like a few times. For example lets say Google doc. Google doc has been one the greatest website that I ever used. In that website, you can do almost everything like book project, essay, making slide shows and other helpful tools. But video conference is pretty helpful too. And my example is like if I need help I can contact my fellow people to help me.

Finally the best way to learned is sometimes online for helpful website and video conference to contact if teacher or other can help me.

6EF7CBB46501,"The statement that the author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote about to do something else just to be someone in the world, it is completely an error. I disagree with this statement, since, I believe that every person think differently. For example, people has their own ideas and ways how to do their own business. Everyone can make a biggest impact in the world, but, by doing what they love. Not what others think that it could be beneficial for you. To be someone in a world you should believe in yourself, make right decisions, and success.

First of all, people could enter in your mind by telling you what could be beneficial for your life or carer. Some of them accept their opinion and do what they do not like, or love. For example, when students are thinking in what career they want to study. Parents influence in their choices by telling about what career would be properly for them. However, those ""properly careers"" it is not in their list of careers they want to study. This action make some teenangers to take that step of let parents choice by themselves.

Otherwise,

they do not help them to mature or even take responsabilities. Everyone should believe in themselves by doing whatever they love, without any interpose in accomplish their dreams. Since, we have the right to build them, it does not matter if we commit an error. Because of our capacities to avoid them or even get over it and keep going.

People has the right to make big choices in life. Making decisions it is hard and important because it could be beneficial, or even worst. However, if you choice with your heart it might be right but by the time you can change your mind. But, you won't regret it about those decisions because as they say, ""You have to learn for every error you commit to be success."" This means that we learn through the past of the time every fall, because you have to stand up and continue your life. It helps us to growing our knowledge to build a better version of ourselves.

Finally, by being confidence to yourself helps you to surpass any obstacle. Beliving in your ideas and trying to make it come true, it tells us that you are persist person chasing for your dreams. Which is quite favorable for person in any career or even job. Because of seeking to be successful at your own way, by do not depend about what others can say. Everyone has a differently perspective than others by doing what you love without any ""obligation"" or to be oppresed.

In conclusion, I am not accorded by this statement, since, we have different points of view. However, I believe that every human being can make their dreams come true without any oppression by others. People should stand by themselves by starting to be confidence in their belief.

In my school we join sports and some after school classes and if we join some sports or some activities after school we have credits and it add up to your grades and people doesn't want to participate because they're lazy and sometimes they make up stories that the have headache, sick, stomach ache, and just skipping after school classes. And sometimes they fail some classes and teachers wants to convince them to join and stay after class and make their grades up.

I have a friend that is a bit of a trouble in school his name is Generic_Name he ask me if I could help him do his work and I said to him that "" You can join activity classes at social studies, or stay after school, and it makes your grades high and you can learn something "" And he didn't followed me, and thats why he still have one F on Social Studies.

If I was the principal I would make every students join sports and make them stay after school for those school activities, and if they have like an F in one class or a missing assignment I would call their parents and ask the parents if their child can stay after class and make their bad grades or missing assignment gone and make their grades higher and get extra credits for participating for after school activities.

And if I was the student I can convince them by letting students know if they have problems on their work or missing assignments I would let them convince to join the after school activities or stay after to do some retakes on their test or quizzes and figure out what is wrong with their grades and fix them and make their grades high. And those who doesn't want to join the after school activities will remain have an F for the 2nd quarter.

The best thing is for the students who want to try or join the team for basketball, tennis, badminton, baseball, hockey, and wrestling is the best thing because few students always wants to join or try for the team.

I know that students should have good grades before you try out for the team. Generic_Name made a decision to stay after class and do the retakes and after 3 weeks Generic_Name has good grades and he try out for baseball and made the team.\

I agree that students should participate to after school classes or sports. Even me I stayed after school just to finish my work or do some retakes and get a better grade this year.

Homework clubs can be useful for kids that can't do there homework at home because they do not have WIFI.

Kids can stay after school and be in the homework club if they do not have computers at home to do essays.

Homework clubs can also help you get better in a subject like math because you can get more 1 on 1 help with a tutor.

Homework clubs can also be used for kids who are in a sport or after school activity the homework club would let you get your homework done quicker in school so that you can go to your after school activity on time.

For example if a kid has an F in math and a teacher gives him extra credit work to do and the kid doesnt understand the work the homework club with be there with tutors to help the kid understand and finish his work.

I believe that homework clubs would be a great way for kids to learn more about the subject they are studying in class.

Sometime dont you feel like your teacher is explaining something too fast and you dont really understand,Well the homework club can help you with that the homework club will get you a tutor to explain to you more about the subject.

Have you ever been in class and kids are talking well in the homework club you would have peace and quite so that you could do your work in peace.

Have you ever had that one class you couldn't pass well I have,so what i did was go to the homework club were i had teachers and other fellow students helping or teaching me what i didnt know about the subject i was struggling in.

The homework club is also a great way to interact with other student.

The homework club is a place for learning not for fooling around so if you want to join the homework club it is because you need help with your homework or classwork.

Anyone needing help is math science or in any subject should join the homework club.

The homework club can help you raise your grade in the class if you try hard and try your best.

The home work club is there if you want to get your homework done is school so that when you get home you can relax.

The homework club also has lots of benefits because you can learn more than other kids and you can get special attention from your tutors so that you can learn more in class.

In conclusion the reason why I want to create a homework club is to help kids that need extra help in class.

I also want to help kids who can't do there homework at home because they have no WIFI.

I would like to help kid who teacher aren't really teaching good so they can have a good grade in that class.

I would like to help kids that need special attention to learn.

These are all the reasons I think schools should have homework clubs.

B1BF25C4C28B,"My mom always tell me "" keep going until you reach your goals, never stop"".

I believe that if we are always doing something we can accomplish more than we can imagine.

First of all, you should never give up on something, it might not work the first time but if we are working consistently on it, one day it will became a reality. For example, when I started 11th grade I was not doing well in Chemistry. I remember each day getting into the class and always starting with a warm-up about moles. The teacher gave us about ten minutes to solve the problems because they were easy, however; I always got almost all of them wrong. Almost all my classmates knew how to solve them, so I was too embarrassed to ask question in front of the class. My friend who's also in Chemistry, understood how to do those problems and much more about chemistry, so I asked her to help me. With her help

I was able to do the problems on my own because she taught step by step on how to do them. As a result, my grades improved a lot. If I'd decide to just let it passed I would've never been able to see how far I could have gotten get if I always keep trying.

Second of all, you should always go as far as you can, never stop at on point just because you think is worthless or you're are not going to make it. For example, the women who's my manager at a fast food restaurant she started as a employee. Most of the coworkers told her that it was going to be challenging for her to be a manager .They were trying to make her stop doing something she wanted to do for her future, they told her to just stay there and see what happens next. Instead, of listening to what people were saying, she worked really hard and accomplish a lot more than she could be able of. If you really want to make something happen, you should always have to work for it, and not think it will just happen as a miracle.

Third of all, some people may argue that doing something over and over again will never work, however; many people are able to prove that this statement is not true. For example, in a TV show about a girl who was always working toward getting into collage failed many times, but she never gave up. Because of her hard work and desire to keep working no matter what, one day she got accepted into a really privileged collage. By always doing something and never giving up is the key to accomplish everything.

To conclude, in order to get something you should never stop working for it. Most celebrities and rich people are where they're now because they always are doing something to make their dreams true and if at one point they had stopped I don't think they would've been successful. This world is full of opportunities but only those who always are working and never stopping are able to take advantage of it.

C24F3DD7A37E,"What are some benefits of having a good attitude, even in a difficult time? A good attitude can make people successful even in a difficult time. But not always people have a good attitudes, and sometimes affects them. A good attitude makes people strong, and to always have positive thoughts and emotions. Having a good attitude helps people to be more intelligent and to face their problems. It is important to have a good attitude because people can face their obstacles, it gives them many opportunities and experiences to learn.

Nobody is perfect in the world, everyone has obstacles to face forward. But having a good attitude can help them to face their obstacle, it help them to never give up, like famous actors of movies, shows, and many more. Before they came to be famous they face their obstacles to be someone in life. They past through many things to be came successful, but they face them with a good attitude and yep sometimes with bad attitudes. Some actors still have some obstacles to face, but they face them with good attitudes.

On the other hand, having a good attitude gives people many opportunities. People often have opportunities but they don't know how to confront them. A positive attitude helps people in their life because it gives them many opportunities, like

Generic_Name,

the mother of a girl, who had face many problems in her life. She never give up and she always was with a positive attitude, when Generic_Name was 30 years old, one of her son's died from Cancer. At that time Generic_Name was very upset, but an opportunity appear on her life. She decides to take the opportunity with a good attitude. Generic_Name always has a positive attitude even during in a difficult time.

Otherwise, having a good attitude gives people many experiences. Experiences appears in people life so they can learn from them, but having a good attitude makes then more fun and interesting. One of the experiences that learn is that when you give money or food to a homeless they shared it with other homeless with a positive attitude. They think about others, even when they don't have to much. A person once said, When give more, you receive more, that is true because when the homeless shared something with others they receive more but they wait with a positive attitude is like they feel happy, they have a good attitude but at the same not all of them have a positive attitude some of them have a negative attitude because they had a hard time.

Overall, having a good attitude can help people anywhere in the world. A good attitude help people in their future they have obstacles to face, opportunities to take, and amazing experiences to learn. Sometimes people imagine their life with having a bad attitude, and everything that they have will be rare because they will not have the chance to learn or to experience. To the contrary of people with good attitudes are awesome because they are intelligent and they have an incredible wisdom. A good attitude is important because even when people have a difficult time they can face them.

First, People now a days just have a mask on and underneath that mask is a unhappy, sad person,and people live with that causing them to have a bad or a fake attitude toward the people around him/her making the environment not a very positive one. Ive always been told not to be mad or get mad at something it will make that situation 10x harder than it needed to be.

second, Surrounding yourself with positive people, people that have a great attitude ,people who love to see you succeed in you goals or at anything, people who dont bring you down, people who support and love you, people that tell you can do it. Hang around people with that attitude and i promise you, you yourself will succeed be happy in and out and have a positive attitude.

Life is always gonna have its ups and downs shoot, shoot i'm only a 17 year old boy and i had lots of barriers lots of downs lots of fake people that have came in and out of my life but my mother that mistakes are the beauty in life that you learn from them and prosper and grow dont let that change your attitude because it will change the way you think the way you talk i can go on and on about how a positive attitude can make you a better person and be successful in life.

Having a negative attitude is just negative and thats a ugly word being negative can impact you in so many ways at work nobody wants to hire a rude or behaved person because it would make the company look bad make your parents look bad and make you look bad. a negative attitude can bring, negative, thoughts negative actions and nobody wants that. even at home having and bad attitude and mama and thats a attitude you are going to regret when you get a smack across the face.

So yes i strongly agree that a positive attitude will take you a long way. Make you a better person and last make you successful person in life. Stay positive in a negative situation because it will make things ten times worse if you are mad or down learn to heal yourself time a time out step outside take a breather and think before you say or do. life is beautiful but its makes it ugly if you attitude is ugly so change it and make yourself a better. healthier person. i know this is out of the promt but to be succesful in life and to be what you wanna be you have to do that yourself nobody is going to do it for you. but first START OFF with making YOURSELF HAPPY for you not for anyone else.

Lening reached his goals because he was never idle, for he was always doing something in his life. Although some say that inactivity serves a purpose because we can wait for the right moment to start an errand or chore, actually being active serves a purpose because we can increase our knowledge in; work,home and gaming and if we are studying a subject such as; Medicine, 3D Animated Cartoons and CyberSecurity we can master it ,and later on we can teach others.

Some say that inactivity serves a purpose because we can wait for the right moment to start an errand or chore. Once a read an article on Newsela that was about how a men waited to start his goal, and he ended up getting his goal very quick. The man was called Generic_Name. Generic_Name wanted to save up to buy a house. He started ti save up for two months, later on he won the lottery, Generic_Name was very happy about it, then he deposited all his money into his savings account. Time pass by and he realized he had enough money to buy his dreamed house. Generic_Name bought the house, and he lived happily ever after.

If we are inactive we can wait for the right moment to start and errand or chore. My Aunt(Generic_Name) wanted to do and errand but she decided to wait because she saw on CNN News that if we wait to do and errand or chore the succession rate increases by 25%. She did the errand and it went more smoothly than ever, he waited to do it and she succeeded on doing it.

Being inactive for a while it's good because if we decide to rush things the odds might be against us. My friend Generic_Name always like to rush things. One day he couldn't wait to buy a game that he went in the middle of the night to buy it. When he got to the store, the store was already closed. He walked form the game store to his house. He was very sad that he could not bought the game, later on he saw a women in white standing right in front of him. He woman in white turn down and he saw her.. the we ran like crazy. It's always better to wait to do something such as buying a game, don;t rush things or you will end up like Generic_Name.

E2456BDC6648,"Conserving energy and resources by attending less days to school. Adopting a four-day school week and only adding two more hours; each day consisting of nine hours. It will help to reduce the consuming of energy and resources. As we go out everyday to complete our duties in the school's building, we consume energy from the sky lights and others useful lights, the computers, and laptops. Also the food students receive in school as a lunch. Plus students frequently purchase gas to come to school; due that some students need to come in their own cars or public buses, because they don't live around the school area. Additionally students that are currently having a part-time job will be able to work more. In the case of student who are not working in a part-time job would get one more day added to the weekend, and they would be able to spend more time doing family activities or having a good time with friends, and close people.

To start with, reducing the consume of energy will help with our planet; energy is produced with some elements and one of them and a very important one is: water. The less energy we use or waist the less will be the affect for our planet. Adopting the four-days school week will make all of us stay at home on Fridays and reduce the energy use from the school when using lights, computers and laptop that need to be charged.

Secondly, If students come to school only for four days, the food that they usually obtain on Fridays will be saved and use for the next Monday; that way saving food will start to be a good benefit for conserving resources. Also some students come to this school but they living in a different city not closely to school; they purchases gas every week and they have to spend money, Therefore if they only come for four days a week; they will saved gas for the weekends or for the next week of school. That's one of the best ways to conserve cars' energy and resources; due to that gas use petroleum to be produced and other substances and chemicals that come from our planet soil grounds or others areas.

Lastly, Students will obtain benefit by adopting this for-days school week as well, because the students that are currently working in a part-time job will obtain the opportunity to work a full day on Fridays, they will be able to increase their revenue. In the case for students that don't have a job, they will have extra time to do homework, projects, and family activities as well.

Even thought, they are students with a different point of view, when it comes to adopting a four-day school week. they argue that adding two more hours to the regular school day, will be more exhausted and they will have less hours to work in their part-time jobs.

In conclusion, Adopting a four-day school week will help to conserve energy and resources. Firstly: conserving energy light and food and saving gas and money, having extra time for work, friends and most important: Family.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.7682924,3.5730186,3.802758,3.6362867,3.507001,3.7008593,3.5779433,3.3615427,3.4009063,2.8657916,3.3710682,3.4932373,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,530,20,0.3754716981132076,26.5,8,9,"{'conserve', 'consume', 'lastly', 'petroleum', 'laptop', 'laptops', 'homework', 'firstly', 'conserving'}"

For me to do accomplish more is better than don't do inactivity. I have 3 reason why I think do more accomplish. First reason is, to be better. Second reason is, do more. Third reason is, feelings. There are some reason why I think that be accomplish is better. For some of the people be accomplish is hard to the people because they don't have to much time.

First reason is, be better is because your learn more, you have more experience. We don't wait our time if we do more job if we have to do more job we doing it. We don't have to be to lazy for do more job if we can do the job. Just if we don't have to much time that will be just to done the work. To do accomplish to spend more time doing it. Whatever thing is if we have time we doing it. I work every day if I have to do more work I do it but if I don't have a time do to my work I just done whatever I am doing.

Second reason is do more. do more can be extra work done that will be nice ti have extra work done for the next day if we do the same we don't have to do more. Extra work have to be complete by the time and then dependently what do you do about. When people do extra work in their job the make more money and also they make more overtime hours in their job but no all the job are the same. For me to do more work is more easy for one think I learn more for, another think I just do extra job because I have time and I like too. To more is when we the people have time

Third reason is feelings, why feelings? feelings is because when we do more work that have to be we are satisfy. In other way we feel like when you make a goal when you done. We have emotional feeling when we done the thing what we doing it and also when we accomplish more. After you finish doing the work we feel tired but is not the same when we are satisfy for done. when I do my extra work always measure that is good. When I know is good

I say ""yes I finishing"" and I feel so proud of me. when we do something we have to be positive for every will be okay.

In conclusion, to do accomplish will be the best idea for to better extra work. The reason why the accomplish is the idea is, to be better, to do more, and the last one is feeling. what Thomas Jefferson wrote ""Determine never to be idle it is wonderful how much may be done if we always doing""

To continue with my experiences in things that I was influence, for example, when I was 12 year old. one day I was on YouTube, and I star see some videos about bloggers beauty, where they have a lot of makeup I do not use any makeup at the age, but when I see that they do their makeup, and look so beautiful I start doing my makeup, and think because I

was wearing makeup I look good, one they my mom ask me, why I am wear makeup, if I told her that I do not like makeup, I just say because they do their makeup. Then, now that I am 19 year old, I released that I was doing things that I do not like because they are doing. clearly, this prove me that I was influences for a famous beauty.

Finally, our parents influences our traits by they expectations. I will say something our parents want we do what they want. For example, we want to go out we are friends, and we ask our parents if we can go they say not, because they thing that our friend is a bad person. Also, they want to change our thought saying that bad thing about our friends, and finally they change are though about our friends. This show that, our parents can change our expectations about our friends. Clearly, parents always want we do what they want, and we always want they want because we do not them mad with us.

To concluded, our character are influenced beyond our control because video game can influences are traits and famous people can influences our traits, and our parents influences our traits by they expectations. technology influenced our character in form that we that life be like them and people can influence our change in the form the we do thing only, because we see they are doing then older people want to change our though to what they thing. To conclude, our character traits can be influences in different ways that we never expect that can happen.

Life can be hard if people don't enjoys their jobs, causing them to have depression. That is why, students should select to visit and learn about the work that interests them because, it gives them more time to think, making plans for their future, and to gain experience through out the school years.

Students should be planning for their future and to decide which class to take in order for them to learn about the work that interests them. Many students have successfully acquired the jobs they intended to work because of how much work they put into to plan and learning the stuff they need to know on how to run the job. Planning is really important for all of our lives. For example, the military uses a plan and tactics in order for them to calculate and for the plan to be successful. Because of that, planning has a big impact in our lives and helps us to decide on what jobs to do and to give us the time to think. This way we can understand the situation and whether or not if the people and their families to decide if it's a good idea.

Students can gain little experience by taking the class every each year, this way students can learn more about the Jobs they want to be in. For example, JROTC are similar to military but trained to be a marching men and to juggle with rifle (from what I know of). They exist because, it helps students to understand what its like for them to experience JROTC. I also think this is very important. It's like, warming up for a swimming contest but, how can you win if you don't know how to swim? Swimming class exist to help people to not drown. If you take swimming class every year, and gain a little bit of experience, you will be able to win the swimming contest. All this reason is to proof of why gaining experience is a good thing and help you understand the job you wanted to applied for.

Giving students the time to think on what jobs their most interested on is also very important for this prompt. For example, students need time to think whether or not if it's the right class for them. Every year in high school students are required to pick three choice to pick their class. It is called the Course Election, where students gets to pick three class that are interesting for them or forced to pick because it is a requirement. I really like this idea, it helps us understand what we're interested on and what to learn. I think three years is enough for students to plan and to have a little experience for their future.

In conclusion, student are more successful if they are to be picked for themselves instead of the school choosing for them, because the more they like the class and the job they are going for, the harder they will try to succeed.",3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.7692533,3.6418047,3.8529038,3.7273195,3.5568485,3.7776594,3.4587953,3.5105824,3.8794363,3.382388,3.4833612,3.640149,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,551,24,0.3684210526315789,22.95833333333333,4,2,"{'drown', 'juggle'}"

As an example for that could be, that every time people is not using a light at their house they must turn it off. Also when students use their computers at school for a long time just playing games and charging it, it's a waste of energy. Not every body understand how important the energy is. This is why bussinesses and schools should adopt a four-day week, with each day consisting of then hours.

Having a four-day work week has their benefits. Workers would only work four days and have three day weekend, they would have more time to rest, and have a time with their families. On the other hand working requires using energy for any type of power tools as computers, printers, and construction tools. Working four days a week will decrease the use of energy.

Also some people drive to their job, and others ride the bus, using this method of working only four days a week will safe the people more resources, as gasoline, money, and vehicles.

As working four days a week has their benefits, it also has their disadvantages. students would have to go school, and workers would have to go to work only four days a week, of each day consisting of ten hours. Students would have to stay at school two more hours, meaning they would waste more energy as they usually do. Workers would waste a very big amount of enegy due by the power tools they use. Students would only go to school for four days, and wokers to work for only four days as well, but each day constis in ten hours, however they still will work for forty hours, as if they worked five days a week, workers and studets will be wasting the same amount of energy and resources.

Being a student and going to school for only four days a week and having a three day weekend has their benefit. Students would have more time to complete their homework, and study for tests. On the other hand going to school requires to waste some energy, and resources, students uses their computer that they need to charge, and teachers uses paper every day, while using this method students and tacher would safe resources and energy. Some students drive to school, others take the bus, or they also drive to academies, this all relates to the wasting of energy and resoruces as gasoline. Otherwise going to school for only four days a week, will decease all the energy used in computer, and the gasoline the cars need to get students to school.

Students going to school only four days a week has their benefits and disadvantages. Students would waste less energy than they do in five days, they aslo would waste less gasoline and money if they only come four days. Having this method the comminuty would safe a lot of energy and resources that can be need it for the future. Schools should follow this model by extending the school days two hours and waste less energy and resources.

Setting examples to others that you are preductive and are accomplishing more and big things, is gonna look good on someone simply because, they see the outcome of the hardwork, and detication put into doing more of something.

In conclusion, if we accomplish more by doing something; we will become remarkable in many differnent ways.

Depending on the way people are raised they may change their behavior over time. If you are brave enough you can choose who you want to be, and you can guide yourself. Everyone is going trough something at this moment, and these are not always good things. People may experiment terrible incidents that are going to change their life forever.

These events are just going trough your life, and sometimes there is nothing you can do to make it different. All these things may change you character behavior. Anyone's personality is going to change if they are not aware of what they are doing, and these actions will lead you to live horrible moments. At this point you no longer have control over your actions and just doing what you want, maybe not knowing what your character has turned into.

On the other hand; will realize what is going on around their live as they grow up, and they are not afraid to know what is happening, they will use this problems to become stronger. As time passes; they will go trough different issues, experiment different changes, but they just don't pay attention to it, and do what they want. Those people usually have control over their life and decide whether they want to change or not. A lot of people around them will try to hurt make them feel different.

For some people is easy to just not care about anything and just care about themselves, it could be a good thing because not anyone is going to make you feel bad. Over time they become smarter, stronger and tougher, but they also know if they need to change something in their life. They were just raised in a different way and a different place that is why they will act different to the rest of people because they also know what is best for them, when something bad is happening they know how to handle it.

These situations may change anybodies personality and eventually they will become a complete new different person. it just depends on the actions they choose to do and the way they see the world. it could be because of tragedies, maybe many bad people around them, they could change if they wanted to. There is many possibilities and reasons for people to change and it will happen at any given point and when they realize it, they are completely different.

It just depends on the way of your thinking, only you can decide if you want to be different, some people may have a weak or strong mind. Some situations are just defined as drastic events that could happen to you and there is nothing you can do about it if you wanted to make it better, only you know if you can handle it. You can confront it or let it change you. Some people will form their own character, or because they don't know what to do anymore.

5241864FBC48,"My Grandma always use to say that ""working with a group is fun and all, but at the end of the day, I would have to understand what the group activity was about, but at the same time working with a group can get more work done and we help each other."" She explained to me that there isn't group work when it comes down to taking a test or quiz. Students are always sitting down and learning maybe getting up and working with a couple of classmates can help learn too. I'm the one in a seat answering the questions on a test or quiz. There is no group work involved when it comes down to that. I think working alone and working as a group can both be beneficial.

First when working in a group I can understand my classmates more than my teacher. I can understand more especially if a student just like me explains everything. I might not understand somethings or tend to forget, however someone in my group could know or refresh my memory by giving me notes, or vise versa. I can get a ton of work done as a group, but do I really understand what I just did. For example, say we have a group of five students, three of them are constantly talking, the other two students are the only ones in the group that are actually doing the work. The grade that the group received was a 95. If the students are quizzed on what they have just completed, the students that were talkative are most likely to get a lower grade than the two students that were actually doing the activity without getting off topic.

Second when working alone there are no distractions. I would get my work done peacefully, at a rate I would like to go. I would not get as much work done as if I was in a group, but the teacher would know that it's all my work. For example, say I'm working with a group, we get a 93 for the whole group work. I received a quiz on what we just did and I got a 78. After that performance, the teacher gave me notes and went over the same material with me. I studied; and I took the quiz again. This time I got a 90. Therefor, this goes to show that working alone helps the teacher figure out what you need help on.

Some people say that working in a group can cause fights,distractions, and poor quality work ethic. I feel like working alone is more beneficial. Everything can not be done in a group. Sometimes you have to work alone to fully grasp the subject. Working alone lets your brain process better especially at it's own rate. The teacher can really see what you need help on.

In conclusion, I think that both working in a group and working alone are beneficial. I think that working alone is more beneficial because everyone works and really understands the subject at a different pace. Working in a group does not show the teacher a specific person's work. Thats why I think working alone can better help yourself and is more beneficial.

EBF9131A638F,"Distance learning is a new learning method for students to attend classes from home by online or you can video conference. Schools have brought distance learning in their system for students can do their assignments from home. Many people think this is a great idea and some oppose to this learning method. The schools can see if they are on track or online to their classes but if they arn't in the online class they will be behind in their assignments. Is this new learning method a great way to learn? or does being in a class with a teacher more beneficial for the student?

The main problem in distance learning is if students are really getting on the online class. Students who do get on are on task and on point. The students who get on the computer and get on the online class for a short period of time at home might be playing, or might not be concentrated, because he is at home and dosen't feel like doing it. Students who don't do their assignments they wait until they are at school because in school you arn't distracted like at home you are concentrated and ready to work. Is distance learning beneficial for students at home? for some students it might be but for many it isn't.

Is online learning at home beneficial for students? some students do think its beneficial and a really great idea. Many people prefer learning in class with a teacher because they can ask questions if they don't get the question that is being asked. Students do some of their work but get off in a short period of time if they are at home, if they were at school the students would be on task and doing their assignments, unlike at home they would be off task. Many students prefer teachers teaching them so they can get more information of what they are being taught. Distance learning isn't capable of doing what you do in a classroom. Is distance learning really beneficial?

Is being taught in a classroom more beneficial for students? many students prefer being taught by a teacher than online. Students are more productive and they share their thoughts and explanations in that specific assignment than online classroom. All the students are in the same page and all gathering more information by writing notes and being concentrated in their tasks. Students are more interactive with each other and sharing thoughts and many techniques to get the answers by fellow classmates, also getting good grades. Classroom learning is beneficial for many students and teachers.

Students have their own way of learning, it doesn't matter if its distance learning nor in a classroom. It is how they feel how they enjoy learning. Students will say this is the best way for learning other no this is, it doesn't matter what you think is the best way to learn its how you enjoy learning something it is the best way for you. The students who prefer distance learning really do it at home and feel like they are learning mush more at than in a classroom. Students who enjoy learning in a classroom like being around peers and want knowledge from everyone around them. They are both beneficial for that specific student.

B3B9D116021C,"People tend to think that setting a goal high to achieve is a smart idea. While the other side thinks that setting a goal low is the better. Although some people may hate setting a goal high and falling short, it can cause a person to give up, but they forget to neglect the part that goals or achievements come in different shapes and sizes. People should be aiming their achievements high because people can achieve more, people can feel more motivated, and people can feel more successful.

Some people may not agree with this position because setting a goal to high and then falling short can cause a person to feel less motivated. they believe this because when setting a goal high and it fails, it can make a person give up and not try. they may think this because when giving up on a goal it can cause a person to feel empty and wanting to not try again. this shows that some people are afraid of failing, and when they do fail it makes them not try again. However, the oppositions looks over other important points.

People should be aiming their achievements high so they can achieve more. when a person sets their goal high, it could mean they are setting multiple goals and not just one, having one goal is great, but having multiple is also fantastic. this can also make the person feel good about themselves, knowing that they have accomplished more than one achievement. it can also make them feel proud about themselves. Even if a person failed one goal that doesn't mean they can't accomplish other goals. People cannot accomplish every goal, all goals are different then one another, but other harder goals can be accomplished.

people should be aiming their achievement high because it can make a person feel more successful. Once a person has completed an achievement it can make them as if they succeeded. it can also help with their confidence, it would give them less anxiety. it also shows that the person who is working towards his or her achievement can do so much more. it can also help some people in the future because they have the confidence they need because they hit different goals. people can also feel like they did something with their life and not feel like they did not accomplish anything in life.

People should aim their achievements high because they can feel more motivated. Setting an achievement means working really hard. It means you must focus on, it should be the only thing you are working on. Most people in their mind focus on this and this is what motivates them to work on one persons goal. In their brain they get this sense of energy, their brain is telling them to work on their goal. that is what make some people want to work towards their goal or try to finish their goal.

So this is why aiming your goal high is a good thing, motivation, success and achieving more can help a person in life if trying complete an achievement. People can get scared of goals, they are afraid it could fail something could go wrong, but the thing is in life you will fail, nobody is perfect, people will have get over their fears and accomplish their goal.

Also depend on where they at in life for a example: people have alot of money the way they want their decisions on future is more short because they don't worry about other thing tact or payment and people are not have alot of money the way they start their future decisions are more longer because they have to worry about alot of money tact, payment, pay for their car,... also they have a to work more extra hard for they decisions.

And my brother was the same thing, he was go to collenge for 2 year and than he don't want to be in collenge more so desige to work, if he continue on collenge maybe he got a better job.

The chose they have and everything that happen around them to make their own future decisions, and all of the support from people around or family can make it more better decisions on their own life.

I think students they will benefit with this idea, because they are not going to spend that much money, In traveling to school eveyday. It will be so much easier taking classes only, because students will have more free time to do their own things, after they're done with all their schoolo work at home: for example; if the students works it will be a better option of taking classes only because he/she will have more time in getting ready for work, and been on time to work.

Reasons why I say it will be a better option taking the classes only or video conferencing, It's because students they don't have to worry, about gettig in trauble for been late to school, Because if students will travel to school schoool, there will be a high posibility of not getting to school on time sometimes it can be for many reasons; for example: traffict issus, parents they might get sick or any other reason, It will be really hard for this students if schools wouldn't offer away to study and learn at home, schools they make it easier for this students who aren't able to come to school, Myself as student i think this is a really good idea made by the school, Bacuse it gives students the oportnity of study at home when they aren't caplable to show up to school for this type of reasons.

I am agree with schools that offers distance learning as an option for the students, Because some students don't have the ability as others students, That has the oportunity of riding the bus to school everyday from Monday to Friday, This students who takes online classes is because they really need it, And they don't have a way of getting to school eveyday , It might be more difficult for them , because they might not have someone to explain them as well as a teacher. Another reason why i think some students students take only classes is because some classes that they like, some school don't have them, and they really want to know about it, Aslo sometimes parents look trought schools to see the classes option they have online so they can apply to see if their sons can takes those classes online to learn about it. One of the major reason why student take classes online sometimes is because they don't have enaught credits, so they have to take classes online, Becuase even if they come to school they won't be able to graduate because they dont have all the credits needed, Some students don't live near the schools to come all the way to school so they decide to take the classes at home.",2.5,2.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.9232855,2.7793593,3.0577004,2.891221,2.718614,2.7204814,2.9345706,2.5387058,2.8663576,2.8327682,2.380496,2.6135468,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,528,8,0.3465909090909091,66.0,25,4,"{'video', 'wo', 'online', 'conferencing'}"
D175411080CC,"Many students become involved in extracurricular activities to enrich their educational experiences, and some even become involved in so many activities that they have little time to study or complete homework assignments. Schools should limit on how much extracurricular activities they can do, having too much will cause confusion among students in class and too much is always not good. having their families decide for them is an option, but the best decision should be for the school, for they know how well the student is doing.

Research from age between 21 to 26 shows that 95% of them wanted to decide for their children,They wanted the best for them and the best they will do, That is the job of the parents. A blog back in 2006 shows that people who decides for their children most likely to get a job than people who decide on their own.

A Research conducted back in 2010 shows that 80% of people prefer to decide for themselves, having them to decide will greatly benefit their mind and shows that they are responsible on how they act. They like to choose their own path and find their own talent. Finding their own talent shows responsibility, and having responsibilities at a young age takes courage, dedication, and hard work.

Having too many activities will also cause a lot of their energy to get drained, they won't have any energy to spare for other activities like cooking for dinner, or doing assignments. The school should keep track on every students activities, This ensure their safety and heath. Having every energy drained from your body is bad, and the school should keep track at their time as well. Having more energy will greatly benefit their health. The school is partly responsible for the students, but the parents are most responsible and should know what their children's are doing, if they think their doing too much, they should talk to them and have a simple chat about overworking.

The school can also add a one simple rule where people who has 3 activities or more should be given time at the end of each classes 15 to 30 minutes free time to discuss with their teacher on how well they are doing and to do missing work or assignments. In Generic_City, Philippines, University of Mang Totomas, Practice this method. Research from this school shows that students have increased their grades when they added this rule back in 1996, it increased from the average of 3.0 GPA to 4.1 GPA, This huge increase show's that adding this simple rule will benefit not only the students health, but their grades as well.

Hard work is good personal ethnic, but too much can lead to more bad than good, studying many subjects at one time can cause confusion and stress, The schools job is to teach students, and the students goal is to learn from school, if they want to learn an extra subject or do an extra activity, that's fine, but aslong as they don't over do it. the school system should ensure students safety to be top priority, and if their wearing themselves out with the extracurricular activities, they should notify their parents or limit how much extracurricular activities they can do.",3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.6550646,3.5343215,3.7292252,3.6677425,3.5035183,3.5745554,3.7846787,3.3101616,4.088394,3.7524745,3.4678352,3.3064668,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,550,18,0.3963636363636363,30.55555555555556,7,18,"{'26', 'blog', 'overworking', '1996', '15', '80', '30', 'extracurricular', '95', '3', 'heath', '4.1', '2010', 'wo', '21', 'homework', '3.0', '2006'}"

To get the job you like makes it more interesting .I would like to be selected to get the job that I am interested in because I want to get the experience and improve my skills to become an experts of it.

Dear Mr. Manager, I heard that you are selecting students to give them the opportunity to work in your company to gain experience, and to see if that job interests them. I want to be one of them, and to see if I am able to do the job the way it should be done. This opportunity can give me the chance to get more experience and to see if the job is interesting for me. I can make sure that if I get the job I will learn more about it. For example, Generic_Name, a smart student in my biology class was always wanted to work in a science department and to be a biology teacher in future. Last year she got the chance to work with Generic_City Biology and Science department. After a while she gives up and didn't continue to her job anymore. The reason that she left the job was that she didn't find it easy and interesting. This chance helped her a lot to select a better option and choose something new. She is happy about it, because she got experience and that was a golden chance for her to see if she is good at science subjects and that changed her mind not to become a biology teacher. Furthermore, I can add that getting the job that you like gives you more positive energy towards it and makes you work hard for it to achieve your goal.

We can't improve our skills until we don't try something new. Improvements always comes from doing something if we set goals to improve our skills definitely we will achieve it. Every job and activity we do we must have some good skills in it, or if we don't we can work on it to improve it. For example, my brother loved to work with

IT companies, he is good in repairing laptops and mobiles. He was studying Cisco and switch repairing at Sterling IT institute. He was doing good in his class, but for improving his skills and to see if he had learned something he needed to get a job. He started making labs at home with his classmates and was looking for a job. After he was approved by one of Cisco companies, he started improving his career and working hard to learn more everyday. After a year, beside that he is studying,he is now serving as a substitute in his institute. It's all because he has more experience and worked on his skills. Furthermore, I can say that having skill and talent can give us more motivation and helps us improve more everyday.

In conclusion, I can say that getting involve in such programs and company jobs helps students to choose their career and gives them the opportunity to see if they really want that job or are they ready for the career that they are dreaming for.

CE43DBA12965,"The growth of technology has made it convenient for people to use anywhere and any time. Technology has made it easier for people to do online education, jobs, and shopping. People are now in favor of this technology growth.

First, online education has made it easier for students to study at home without worrying about how they are going to get to school. I'm in favor of the online education because it made it easier for me to take my online classes at home and I can do my assignment any time I want to do it. The online education is also convenient for students in colleges; most of the students in colleges study at home because they don't have to worry about transportation, nor the gas money for their car. My brother is in college and where he lives they get a lot of snow in the winter, so it make it hard for to go to college. Now he does not have to worry about the weather because he can study for his classes online.

Second, most people are now doing online jobs because the grown of technology. In my opinion the most popular online job is to be a you tuber; a lot of you tubers film their lives and put on the internet then the get money of it. One of my friend is a you tuber and he gets decent amount of money just form putting videos of him self on the internet. The way YouTube work is the you tuber up lodes a video on YouTube and if he gets a lot of views then he gets a lot of money. Another online risky job is buying and selling in stocks. One time I bought an online stock form the company Tesla and it was really good price, after three months I sold the stock double the amount that I bought it in the first time. When people buy stocks from other company is like having a percentage of the company that buyer own. The risky part about it is people never now when the stock will go up or down.

Third, online shopping has made it convent for people to order everything online. The most popular online delivery is Amazon; Amazon made people lives so much easier by having everything delivered to their houses. When I order online I always order from Amazon this company has everything I need for me and for my family. Amazon also has fresh grocery that they deliver it for the costumers in the same day that they order it. In these modern days other stores are now delivering online, so people can buy their needs while they are at home.

Although technology has made people lazy and decreased the communication between humans, but it made easier for student to do their homework, it made it easier for people to make money while they are at home, and it made easier for those people who don't like to do grocery shopping in the stores.

In conclusion the growth of technology has helped a lot of people with their lives including student and online workers. All people are in favor of this amazing growth of technology because it has helped them to make their lives easier. I think that people are going to proceed with growth of the technology because it's making people lives run smoothly.

B744CD534ADB,"Dears, teachers of Generic_School.

First, I think that we all should work alone, because each student can be working for their self with out any other help from students that do not care about their projects or homework, all students has different ideas, working in a group would be more stressed for the student, they may not have the opportunity to show their own ideas working in a group. However, working in a group sometimes can be helpful but working alone can be more helpful to the teacher, working alone, the teacher would see who deserved a good grade, working in a group one of the persons can be the only one who does all the work. In addition, working alone can be the best way to show our own ideas because everyone has different opinion about the projects or the homework and how is going to be, working alone should be more helpful for the student who had different opinion in their topic.

In my English class we all were working in groups, well in my group were three people one of the group was at their phone seen social media, and doing nothing, I ask if he needs help and if that was the reason why you are not helping us to do our project, I said, he just answer and said don't ask me, that's not your problem, he was unreasonable but there wasn't nothing more that I can do for someone who do not want to work, that's one of the a lots of reasons why is not helpful working with a group.

Wherever, I believe that working alone is the best way to show up our mind and be sure that we can do all that we want to do, some people think that working in a group they can get done more fast any projects but I think that we should work alone because there is some people that do not care about their subjects and sometimes the teachers think that they just do not want to do nothing but there are people that we really want a good grade, working alone let the student to focus more in their own work than someone who is stressed about if his partner is going to help or not. Some people said that working in a group it's more fun than working alone but I think that working alone some times can be also fun because you make your own rules and use your own imagination.

In conclusion, students should work alone, each students can be working by their self and with out thinking if their classmate is going to help in any kind of project, all students has different ideas, working in group would be more stressed for the student, working alone can be more helpful to the teacher, the teacher would see who deserved a good grade. Working alone is the best choice, teachers considerate students ideas like the most big new option to improve our society, working alone is the best way to show our own ideas, by working alone students will be feel more confident about their work and more likely to explain their work. Finally, students can work for their self, and is not always necessary to work in group, sometimes work in group can be annoying and distractive by others students.",4.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.5,3.2288504,3.0500336,3.299389,3.1463828,2.9607363,3.1636205,3.1307578,3.160466,3.4218848,3.2992525,3.0703692,3.2197294,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,566,10,0.303886925795053,56.6,4,4,"{'dears', 'classmate', 'unreasonable', 'homework'}"
DFB7AB4481AC,"I think that people can success without having the cosists of failure without loss of enthusiam. There's other way to success without failing, one of them is to practice. An another way is sometime you can get it on your first time without have to fail. Then you can just study other's failure and not make them same mistake, or sucess and try to do the same. These are other way to success without having to fail, and they are maybe more ways also. So Winston Churchill isn't wrong, there's still other success with out failure.

First you can practices, practices makes you better that thing to want to success with. It like you can't success to be the best soccer player if you don't practices. So instead of taking the test or what ever if you practices, you might not fail, you'll be ready for it or good to do it. If you want to success in a sport, you can success by practicing you can build mussel memory that can help you in many ways. If you want to success on a test you can practices on practices tests, that can help you out. That one of the ways you can success without failure.

Also you can success by getting it are on you first time, there's some time people do will on their first time without having to fail, practices, or study. They are mostly lucky when that happen, and it does happens much, but they still success. Most people like to call this, winging it, some people might success, and some might not but that a other way so still success. it might be the best way success, but might have done it and success for it.

Another way people can success, is by watching other's failure and success. When you watch other's failure you can study and try not to make the same mistake as they did. So if you saw some player or some slowed down when they were about score, but they miss or someone block them you can say, ""they shouldn't have slowed or whatever that would have help them. So when it your turn you can try to not make the same mistake and success. You don't just have to watch their fail, and can also study their success and try to do the same thing. So by watch others people success and failure, you can copy their success or improve their failure.

So Winston isn't wrong you can success form your failure. By look on your mistake and improve them and making you'll self better, at what you have trouble at. Failure without loss of enthusiasm is better then getting so mad about it and might make it easier to success next time.

So I don't agree with Churchill's statement, because their is more then just failure to success. There's so much way to success with having to fail. You can practices, study other's failure and success, and sometime success on you first time by winging it. So those are some reason, why i don't agree with Winston Churchill.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,2.8529997,2.6999068,2.9681811,2.7616072,2.5033662,2.7503557,2.8066013,2.9831147,3.1867285,2.7715147,2.882196,3.2348952,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.5,538,29,0.3066914498141264,18.55172413793104,9,3,"{'winging', 'mussel', 'soccer'}"

Imagine how many accidents happen in they week because the use of the technology using programs a lot. Generic_Name was driving and playing his favoitrs games online,and he did not look to the red light. Limitatios with humans can cause many problems in your life. We need to have limit technology use. Technology gave negative effects in time with family, driving while you are testing, and energy electricity.

First of all, families have limitation of time to talk about their problems because they dedicate more time to technony. For example, Generic_Name was a girls in public high school. She was talking with an old man; the man was looking everyday, and she do not figure out because the man told her that he was in another country. Next, she did not talk with the families and she was one more of many young victim of kindnap. Another example, peoples in families use technology inapropiately causing get all on troubles and having less communication between them as human.

Secondly, some people prefer to talk in text message while they are driving. This is cause of many accidents peoples use devices in their car. Sometimes person does not even look who is begin stting next to them. The are some problems as someone told me. Generic_Name was driving with his mother who was in another country: She came to see him, but he did not left the phone alone and look at his back the computer after a two miles, they crash crossing a railroad. Also, we knows the risk of doing it. People think tha using technoly and have less communication with their family anywhere is safe, but they are wrong because one distraction for our limitation with others human can be deadly.

Thirdly, energy is anothers problem because people spend more money. Even know, this increase a lo of accidents because custome's companies just buy lof of thing as computer, cellphone, and toys. The problem is many peoples spend more time plugin in setting beside its divice charger to get some energy in their computer or cellphone. One more example in about this problems Generic_Name was addicted to the computer in his room. He was charging it. He was friendless because of this reason, and Generic_Name did not talk with his family as normally; however, he just say good bye everyday.

In conclusion, Everyone has to stop using technology for unimportant reaso or things. This will be more safe for you and your family. In ddition, limitation of human contact have more consecuences while you are with your family, driving, and spend more enery. It's your time to chane this word. ACT NOW!!! you can chane verything talk to your mother, father, and your whole family and peoples. I change. I am waiting for you because we do not want our future generation get adiction.

78DD2317E359,"What Minister Churchill is trying to say is that going from failure to success is not gonna be easy in life. What could they do to reach their career and have success? People will agree with this statement. Not everyone is gonna succeed in life, we all make mistakes. People just got to try harder even if it takes years to achieve. Failure is not the end of the world, people just got to find what is best for them. Going from failure to success in life is not easy, but they just got to have the potential to reach that goal.

First, some people may tell others that going from failure to success is a good thing. For example, my friends told someone that playing basketball is not a good sport for him, but overtime he has gotten better at basketball. Most people in the world are gonna say ""practice makes perfect."" Another example is that my sister wanted to go to UVA, and she studied hard to get into that college, my family thought they wouldn't accept it, but a few weeks later, they accepted her in UVA. Things aren't gonna be easy, people just got to understand that it is life, we just got to work harder.

On the other hand, most people in the world experience this. There is not one person in the world that didn't have any issues throughout their whole life. Even in school, it is very unlikely to find someone that is not having a hard time with there classes. Everyone was not smart when they were born, people got to work for it to get smarter. Here is another example, my Math and History have good grades, but my English and Science don't have good grades, so not everyone is gonna have good grades, people have strengths and weaknesses, they just got to study and work because not everyone is perfect.

In addition, some others may say that going from failure to success is a waste of time. Others say that it won't help their career in the future. People think that there is a lot of information in school, college, and even a job that they have to go through just to have success in life. They also say that they have to work hard to pay for their house, their bills, health insurance, car insurance, and even for their family. The people in the world that say that it is a waste of time are the people that can be homeless or the people that just have no life at all.

Lastly, the reason why that everyone should always go from failure to success is because it's gonna make people feel good about there selves. Another reason why you should be successful is if people finish everything they need for their career, then they don't have to deal with it in the future than having to deal with it later. Also, it is a good idea if they study and learn the materials they could accomplish. Even if people don't succeed in life it is fine because they still have a chance, all they got to do is to study hard and work hard for it because in the future they will not regret it.

ED74D2C2403B,"Sometimes take classes from home not can be helf students to improve their learning. Although some schools offer distances learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way online or video conferencing. I disagree to students take the classes on home because they not learn the same as in the school, if students have a question, or doubt did not have a teacher to asking, and Students did not have the same opcion like others students.

The students who take classes from home, not learn the same in the school and this can be are difficult for them. For example, most of students lose the test because they forget the impormation that they learn in online classes and the time of the test they not remember enyting. Sincerity, take classes from home it is difficult for students the short learning because they not have the same capacity like others students. The students can be improve in the school more that from home, because from home they teaching they self. In addition, most of school believe that give classes from home can be helf students, but this is a big error.

If the students have a question, or doubt did not have a teacher to asking since, they answer themself. For example, sometimes the students do not know how to make homework, project, etc and they need someone to helf them. Also, every students need a teacher to explain everything that they need to make, and if they make the classes from home is impossible to make the thing good if did not have a teacher. It not the same to make the calsses online or in school because in online it is person who teaching for only a short moment, nevertheless in the school the teacher teaching for like 8 hours and helf in sonthing that students need. In effect,

some students do not have capacity to make the classes from home, they needing to make the classes in the school to learn more.

Students did not have the same opcion like others students like the time or the learning. For example, most of them have a job and they not have the time to take the classes from home, because they lose the time in the job and when they going to the home they are tired and only going to sleep. While, the others students improve their life in the schools the others students who make the classes onlone not learn enything because they not have time. Make the classes from home it is not necesary for students because they can going to school every day and work after school and with this method they have more chance to improve they learning. Truly, The school give the option but the students have the choice.

In conclutiong, they not learn in the classes from home that in the school, and this can be affect tehir learning. They teaching themself because in home tehy do not have a teacher to helf them. THey not have same opportinity like others students because they can be not have time to make the all thing. Some school have this option but it is not a good idea for students because they not focus in online classes and they fail.

However, it is a good example by your own behavior the best way to influence other people. People may follow every step you do, because they want to success in life by being influences by others. It is the main thing to show people that they can do what they think they are not able to do.

First reason is, People may follow every step you do, because they want to success in life by being influence by others. For example, my friend

Generic_Name has a son, who according to her he wants to be a lawyer. Generic_Name husband who's name is Generic_Name is a lawyer. Although their son Generic_Name is taking only math classes in collage, which it has nothing to do with laws. Generic_Name and Generic_Name want to influence Generic_Name to become a lawyer. But Generic_Name is being influence by his Algebra class teacher. Generic_Name has a very high score on math, and his Algebra teacher believe that Generic_Name can be a math teacher in a college. Generic_Name teacher knows how hard he works to do everything right and how his behavior it is showed.

Another reason is, It is the main thing to show people that they can do what they think they are not able to do. For example, when my brother was nine years old he wanted to be a Pilot, but he was just really scared of heights. When my brother graduated from high school he wanted to go to Army. Somehow my mom find out that he really did not wanted to do that what he really wanted to do was being a Pilot. My mom is a Flight Attend and she told my brother that some people will say you are too weak to do this and that, but they actually does not know what you are capable to do. With those words my mom influence my brother, and now he is a Pilot and he works for the Air Force. My mom gave him an example that no one believed on her the only person who believed on her was her mom. As my mom says, "" Don't let other people think you are not able to do things, which they we're not able to do.""

Some people may think that there are better ways to influence others. However, it can be true, but people get more influence by examples. There are not many ways for example, if someone who is very important who wants to influence someone else who is not that important to be come important as they are. Does not mean this person is going to have the same luck to become really important. Do not let other people influence you by other ways, let them give you an example of how you are going to success.

In conclusion, It is a good example by your own behavior the best way to influence other people. To teach them what it is good and what it is wrong to do. Given your own examples and teach them how to behave. Dot let people think that example is not the main thing to influence others.",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,3.318483,3.2207525,3.3993423,3.2446635,3.0856094,3.32402,3.7562678,3.0391827,3.3750274,3.0877247,2.9527016,3.4898934,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.5,544,29,0.3547794117647059,18.75862068965517,6,3,"{'algebra', 'mom', 'influencing'}"

For those who can pay a fee for it would be perfect because they have the material to do that, like enternet, computer, or any other device to joing by online or video conferencing classes. Some students woul benefit from being able to attend classes from home, but just those who really need it, like students with disability or health problems. It would not benefit students whom have a hundred percent of their ability to develop anything, it would make them more lazy than what they normally are.

Generic_Name is a student who has a hundred percent of his ability but he does not like go to school. He is always skiping classes and never make homework. Generic_Name is a student with health problems who can not assist to school like a normal teenager because he has to be connect to a oxygen tank twenty four, seven. Generic_Name does not want to go to school and Generic_Name can not do that. The school which both of them used to attend is offering a distance learning program for students and the first two students who joing are Generic_Name and Generic_Name. If schools decide to create this program for students, them most priorize at the moment to acept students.

Distance learning program as an option for students to attend classes from home. It would benefit thousands of students whom really want to learn and be successful in their life. If schools which have this program available for students allow students like Generic_Name and Generic_Name to be part of it. The one who is going to be benefit more would be Generic_Name because he is the one who really need this program, he is the one who want to learn new stuff, he is the one who want be someone in the future. Generic_Name would be just one more of those students who are trying to take the easy way for everything, acting like if the world goes around him. But there is also an amount of students who can not have access to enternet or any electronic device to access to the online classes. So it turns a problem for those who does not have acces to any of those things and has health problems like Generic_Name or who does not have enough money to have what they need to participate. The online classes would be hard to them no matter what. If schools created a plan for those students it would be more easy to them to develop themself.

In conclusion some schools are offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home, for students who does not have a hundred percent of their ability, student with health problems, students who really need it. Them also may create a program that help students without enough economy to take those classes. If schools are creating new ways or programs for those whom really need it, them most think about all the needs that them have and try to supply it, not with a hundred percent but helping with what they can.

FB5F33FEC99F,"Did you know that participating in after school activities or clubs benefits students educational wise?

Weather it's joining a sports team, or theater art, or even practicing an instrument, they all educate you in a way.

There are many activities that arent just educational, but students will also find enjoyable, such as sports, art and music.

There are many types of sports, football, basketball, soccer and many many more to choose from.

Sports teaches you a lot about health, and why it's important to stay healthy. It also helps you stay fit and in shape. Playing sports can also give you a scholar ship for collage, but all that a side it's also fun and enjoyable. You get to hang with your friends, compete with other schools and teams, carry the schools name, and most importantly win trophies and receive rewards.

At some schools, they even let you go on field trips to other states to fields and courts to compete with other teams.

It's nice to have so many people come and support you and cheer you on at games, even when it gets competitive.

Drawing, painting, doodling or crafting are all ways of art. Some students have a hard time expressing their feelings, so they do it through art. They express their feelings and emotions through the colors and the designs and subliminal messages they hide in their paintings.

Art clubs get to go to art museums and art gallery's that inspire and improve their talent.

They even get to do art competitions and win prices and art gallery's of their own to hang on the walls around the school. Painting or Drawing your mood is one way to enjoy yourself and become more passionate for the talent you have.

Art is very deep, interesting and meaningful,yet many people don't really understand art that much. It's fun to experiment with colors and textures, for art has no limit.

Many students join bands and music clubs simply because they enjoy playing or singing.

There are many different types of instruments to choose from, like band and string, but they are very different.

bands do not include string instruments, nor do string instruments include band.

Singing is also one of the ways students like to have fun and enjoy themselves, as well as playing there favorite instrument. Music is also art and a talent that not most people really have. students get to go to opera's concerts and very famous theaters to meet very famous musicians. They also get to preform on stages and before every school game, they also get to compete in music competitions were they get to earn and receive valuable rewards.

They also get to upgrade their instruments every year to the finest quality.

Learning should not be all serious, strict and stressful,but should be fun, enjoyable and lovable. Education is important, but loving to learn is more important to sussed. These activities and clubs teaches students something new everyday and helps in developing the brain skills.

One way that importance of attitude is key to success is it motivates you to keep going forward. For example when you come across some difficulties you wont feel discouraged because your the limit and none other then you can or will change it. But the more discouraged you tend to feel at that moment you would wanna overcome it even if it makes whatever just as long as your mind is set to positive attitude you will accomplish it. Then so always remember what you put your mind to such as determination, positive attitude, willing you can its possible you will reach your goals. However you will with a positive mindset have a strong determination and you will build up self confidence in yourself.

Then another reason is to grow individually with hard work. Positive attitude isen't quite the easiest for some people its really difficult for others to learn how to or even if they are willing to. But others tend to not always have positive attitude in anything they're just negative and havent tried to give their all they are stuck upon what others think. Then about what really is,you just have to not listen to what anyone thinks and focus on what you can accomplish because if you dont you will let them reflect on you but you dont want that for yourself. Then there's always going to be that one negative person to try to bring you down its up to you if you let it effect you. Just ignore them if you dont you will bet it affect you and you dont wanna fall back just because of others. With that being said in order to move forward you have to go though things individually but thats were you find yourself again and makes you stronger then before what your weaknesses were there not anymore because when facing things individually you blossom to a beatifull flower with of course hard work and it isen't in vane because hard work ends up having a good result for positive attitude.

Next reason is to build selfcondifence. When having a positive mindset and most impotently willing we then build selfcondience our mind is a battlefield and we control it and its not about the selfcondicence its more about determination ourselves to it like we can or we will do it. After that its all depending on us weather we want to or not. Then after that the more we practice being positive in our battle fild the more selfcondidence we will have.

So then i hardly agree on positive attitude can guide you to succeed in life its all about three things determination willing and believing with those in mind you can tell all the negitive thoughts to go flying out the window because it has no door to let it in anymore. I truly incuage you to try it out if you want to see a big improvement to succeed in your life.

AE178808D4FB,"An enjoyable way to spend time outdoors would be to go to a state park. Spening time outdoors is a good way to relex yourself. Also because then you can enjoy new activities. Doing outdoors activities is a good way to learn new things and explores stuff. Outdoors activities is a good way to spend time with your family,friends. Doing outdoor activity can calm down all your stress and make you feel fresh. Outdoors actvities are important for you because they keep you energized and you do need to spend some times outdoors not only indoors.

Someone might find going to a state park enjoyable because thee will be a lot of fun activities you can do there. Also because then you can discover new things there. In state parks there are varities of new resources and things you may enjoy. There are more fun activities but in my opinon i think going to a state park is more enjoyable and fun. Going to a state park is a good way to spend your time because it can keep you energized and active. State parks do have a lot of space where you can sit and talk to your family or friends. State parks may have a food court aswell.

State parks can be small or big but it depends on which one you are going to. Usally state parks are big and filled with beautiful flowers. There may be a age limit on some of the state parks activities. You may think that parks are boring but you are wrong because parks do have fun activities but i know some parks are boring but parks like state park, community parks, and national parks aren't. If you don't like parks then you must go to a state park because they are really beautiful and may change your thoughts on going to a park. You can also book a birthday party or just a regular party and it will be really fun to book a party because state parks are really big and you will have enough space.

I know you may be wondering when is a good time to go to the state parks, well in my opinion i think going to state parks when its sunny and a good weather because you need that vitamin D. There are different timings when the state park will open each day so you may need to take some time out to go there. On weekends the state parks may be full and you may not even have space to sit but on weekdays there not that full so i think you may wanna go on a weekday so you can have enough space to play around or spend some time with your family, friends. Taking small kids to state park can make them happy and have time to play around.

At some state parks you may find some beatiful butterfly's flying around, isn't that beautiful. You can also meet new people and make good friends there. State park is just a peaceful and calm way to spend your time. If you look forward to going to a park then go to a state park because it has everything you want in a park. State parks don't have any fees to enter it its just opened but you may have to pay for the activities. Thats why I think outdoors activities are important.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5234518,3.51054,3.6199272,3.6226058,3.5518696,3.406392,2.9507315,3.1449628,3.534126,3.1284354,3.2783508,3.3838935,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,577,29,0.317157712305026,19.89655172413793,12,8,"{'weekdays', 'timings', 'explores', 'energized', 'enjoyable', 'wan', 'weekday', 'butterfly'}"
0230A077F5B6,"some school districts offer programs that allow high school student to graduate in three years insted of the tradional four years. I believe that high school student should not allow to graduate in three years. Beacuse for example they are not going to have free time with friends, it's hard for student who learnd new language and some student work afther school. Did you imagen yours child spend all day at school studying hard out seem their parents most of the day just want tham graduate in less then four years.

To begin with, all single child or student need to have free time play with the friends the student don't have to worry about stay afther school to study. most student like afther school go to thier friends houses to play video game, go to eat restaurent also student who graduate in four years don't have to be take any clases during summer or evenings. they can have time to play any sport they like during summer insted of be in at school taking any clases.

In addition for those student who are learning a new language three years is not enought time to learnd every single studnet differnt time to learn some of than learn faster than others student this program that offer that allow high school student graduate in three years,may have to know that each student laern differenly. Anothers disavanges to graduate in three years insted of four is that student don't have time to secand chances to take any felling sol or test they must have to pass each test or sol each years to able to graduate. I feel that is too much prechers for student who learning a new language that they don't have enought time to learn better, that can effect the student when they want to attend to go to callage. It's song that one years can't make any different but,for must of student will be make different,in one years we can prepere student whow callage are what is the different bitween high school classes and callage classes.

The least but list as we know some student work afther school the issue is that this student don't have time to do their homework and study for any test some tham student work fourty hours per week they are going to sleep late night it's hard to attend to school everyday and work at the same time. they just not focus in school they have anothers responsability for example, help their family pay bill or rent so,this student may take the four years to graduate from high school they can do some make up some work and study.

Inconclusion In my opinon the student from high school should not allow to graduate in three years we can keep traditional four years. in this case the student can have more time to play with the friends, time to learn better a new language learn more in high school to be ready for callage and they can have time to help their family with anything this programs should help the student to keep traditional four years the student are future any country may have suppor with are better for them.

6D9728CB8711,"School should add one and a half hour to school each day. because student will get to learn more,student can get more help from teachers,also student can do more sports.

First of all,student will learn more if school board add one and a half hour to their school day. probably student will learn more because their classes will be extended. Also they can get more time in each class,so they can get more information and learn more about each subject. Also they will have the opportunity to do more activity in class. And learn how to work with others. And listen to different opinions and get to a conclusion,For example if some student are good in a activity and others are not that good. They can have the time to work as a group and explained what they are good at and what they need more help, so they all can help each other. They will also have time to work by them self. And passing there SOL.

Secondly, student can get more help from teachers. It will benefit all the student in the school, because some student need more help and different subjects. So they can have the time to go to their teachers and get some help. for example some student needs help in Math,English,civic etc. But some student are better in that subjects. So they can used one and a half hour to do another period. In that period student can go to the classes that they need more help. It will be better for some student because each student are different. And learn in a different ways . It does not mean that others are smart. It means that some student learn better in small groups. Some student learn more faster than others. Extending school it will help them get their grades up,By retaking quizzes and test and finish unfinished work. they can get help in homework too because homework is like practice,they can practice what they learn in class and get a better score in quizzes and tests

Finally,student can have the time to do more sports. With some of their schoolmates. They can have different sports. For example soccer,basketball,baseball,kickball and more sports..Student can make a vote, for what sports they will like to be in. They can learn new skills and get better by playing that sport. and get more healthy because they are playing a sport. because a big percent of student used a lot of their technology at home and don't do any sports. By extending school it can motive them,by doing some sports with their friends. They can play a lot of sports and see which sport they prefer to play,and see in which sport they are good at. They can do more activity for example Art, photographing for people that like to be creative.

In conclusion extending school it will benefit student in different ways. for example getting help from their teacher so they can get better in that subject and get good grades,Getting more time in class,They can get more information. Finally playing sports,they can be healthy and have a hobby that they like to do after all the information that they had learn during the day,some people like to do different activity like Art photographing.

AC9719A6A375,"is setting a good example by your own behavior the best way to influence other people i agree that setting a good example by your behavior is the best way to influence people when giving a good example your trying to influence and direct the people so you must have a good behavior in order for them to be persuaded, you must also have good details to provide to the people or your clients,and good examples can guide you to next step or level.

when setting a good example for other people you want them to be to be persuaded, and to follow the example. so you must have a good attitude and a good behavior. when providing a information to other people you have to make sure that what your saying make sense and its accurate. i have a little brother that wants to play basketball just like me, every game i have he come and watches me play, the moves he see me do in the game, if he likes it hes gonna tell me and when i get home i show him the examples on how to do those specific moves. when you show good examples people will folow and will be pass those examples down to somone else.

good examples can guide you, to the next step or level. when i'm taking a test at school, it always begins with a three question example and it lets me know what i am going to be dealing with, so when I take the test i know what i am going to be expecting on the test ,and i am also gonna know what to do on the test. examples can help a lot of people succeed. when your working on any school work or classwork it always starts with an examples on how to show you how to answer the problems and do it. little examples can provide people with a lot of information. if you pay attention to the examples it can really help you in the future. some lawyers use examples when talking to a judge in court to help them understand or to persuade them.

when providing information to other people you want to make sure your attitude and behavior is on point in order for them to listen. my parents sometimes have trouble using technology so when they need help i'm ready to show them examples on what they are having trouble on, they know they can always count on me,and that is the type of behavior if they ever need any help. a lot of people doesnt tolerate poor behavior. when my English teacher is giving the class an example on what we are going to do later that day she makes sure that each and one of his understands what we are doing before she moves on. the source that your providing you have to make sure it actually or if it can other people out.

although some people may say giving a example with your own behavior may not work for a lot of people. another way you can show an example, is by showing them in person. I sometimes have trouble making or creating something so i got to watch someone else do it in order for me to do it. showing direction to people in person will make it somewhat easier for the the person to understand,instead of just telling them. you can influence other upon your action and they might follow id your attitude is good.

E70DD00622DB,"From my personal experience back in middle school, I had to use technology for many different reasons. One of the reasons were for research purposes. I was able to use technology as a tool to provide information on my assignments and projects. So far technology has made a positive effect in my life not only in school but in real life. Technology has helped me accomplish and complete many difficult task in life. I believe that technology has made a positive effect on people's lives; consequently, it makes peoples lives a lot easier and convenient.

One reason that technology has a positive effect on people is that they are able to study without having to go out on a library and pay for books or a tutor to teach them. For example, people who are disabled or unable to travel out of their houses are able to go online and research for books and look for a site to teach them what they need to learn. The availability to go online and research for information also helps students who are too busy to go outside and ask others for help. Many schools started providing laptops and iPad's to students who are unable to connect online. Schools are using these electronics because they provide an easier way to help student learn and complete work.

Technology can also help people do many other things online other than researching for information.

Furthermore, technology may also be used as a way to shop whatever and whenever. For example, eBay and amazon is an online shopping website for many things such as: furniture, clothes, food, and many other reliable things. This has made it a lot easier for people to purchase items that they want at any time. Online shopping helps a lot of people who are looking for items that cannot be found in local stores. For example, many custom equipment's and items can only be found online and in places that may not even be located in your place. Not only does technology may be use as an online tool, it may also used as a way to communicate to others in the world.

Lastly, communication has been a major part of the world; in addition, technology has been one of their ways to communicate. For example, our military has improved a lot throughout the years due to the inventions of many technologies. Technologies such as: cellular devices, radar, satellite and many other communicating tools has helped us win wars and accomplish many things around the world. Another reason why technology has had a positive effect on people is that they use it for emergency purposes. For example, if an adult needs to call out of work for the day because of family problems, he may use his cellular device to call and inform his supervisor about it.

Many people say that technology is a way to showcase yourself as a lazy person and I disagree with that. I believe that technology allowed many people to accomplish and complete many task. Technology is not only important to the civilians who are either students or adults who are working in the industry, but it is also important for the military who are using these tools to provide protection to our country and keep our people safe. In conclusion, technology has had a positive effect on people's lives and that is due to many reasons such as online researching, online shopping, and wide spread communication.

AB6284069E18,"Some schools offer education at home, online, and or video conference calls. Teachers and some students believe that off campus is horrible. The reason why is : you won't have an actual human teaching you with online classes ,Video conference calls aren't great because most people aren't paying any attention to the teachers or student also you would need more assistance which is just unnecessary. Then finally you won't meet any people and you won't learn how to socialize at the end you won't learn how speak to people.

The school that offers these programs should just destroy these programs. Students should learn to how to go to school. Learn how to make friends,teachers,also day to day people. Just go get an education which is very important thing to do and that needs to happen if you want to do anything for the future the place they should just get an education is on a on campus school.

To the schools that offer the out of school education some that are at home,online,and video calls. Teachers and a lot of surveys show that having students with out of school education tend to have lower grades, more missing assignments,and less people in there lives. The facts just show that if you aren't at a on campus school,You're grades tend to be way lower then the average student on campus student. If you don't go to on campus schooling you will become social awkward. It's not fun staying home

With the online classes these days it has some benefits but the end of the day it's still a very bad distraction usual for example people love to watch television while doing work , but they aren't doing the assignment with 100 percent attention. If you want to get something done do it the right way. Also with the student they have many ways to cheat with any kind of education that's not on a on campus school cheating is 100 percent wrong not the right thing to do. Studies show that if you have two or more things that you are doing you are doing at the same time they aren't using there whole brain to do they're work. One of the major reason why online classes aren't good because you can just google the answers that's just cheating you aren't learning it's cheating.

Video Conference calls are just a waste of time. Students don't listen or even look at the screen to the call. It's just better and useful if you went to school. Just go to school you won't have to do calls and extra things like calling over and over again. Also it teaches you not to be lazy. If you go to school you wouldn't need to call or anything of the sort just go to school and get an education.

The school should destroy these programs and students need to go to an on campus school education or they won't be able to anything for the future for there education because they didn't pay attention or learn it well plus they won't have any friends to know them.

In conclusion students should be able to go to an on campus school just like the rest of us and meet new people and friends for the future.

BB8DBBD8C4AB,"I agree with this statement, because is hard to be yourself, in a world like this, where the people judge everything in your life, and you have to be how they want, they always are telling you what you have to do or what you not, and they not care about your opinion.

A example:

In my personal life is with my family, they always are telling me what I have to do, and when I do something wrong they judge me, they want to select my friends, my clothes, include my shoes, in a situation like this is difficult to be what you really what to be, and the razon is because they don't give us a chance to demostrate what we really are.

Another example is:

With the people of outside, we never are going to be how they want, if they saw you with a boy who use tattoo they think he is a bad boy, if you are a fat girl your ugly, if you are skinny girl your ugly too, if you use a mini skirt you are a creazy women. So we never will be fine.

Everybody can judge, but we have to be strong, we have to try to demostrate what we are, or what we like to do.

Razons:

We can have a lot of bad situations in this life, Maybe one day we can feel bad or sad, Because we not feel good with the people who judge, maybe we are tired to feign to be another person, or maybe we can think in a negative way. A example of this could be say ""I never do something good"", "" I am not a good person"". So we need to be what we want to be, and love yourself is the most important thing, if you not love yurself no one can love you more then you, obviously we have to know what decisions we want to take, you have to feel good with yourself, with your decisions. You have to show what you are, if you feel good you will be good.

All this are razons for which one is hard to be yourself, and is for that razon i agree with Mr. Ralph Waldo Emerson, cause i feel identified with what he say; I feel a winner, i feel happy with my personality, and is because i don't care what the people say, or think about me, is my life, I take my decisions. If I am a creazy women who always is imperative but i feel good with that am fine. I like to be happy, be my self. I really love me. I don't have to feign nothing. The little girl who always was doing what the people saying is in the past not in my present. I learning to be my self, so ""Yes"" I make a greatest accomplishment in my life, and is nice to be your self, now i feel relax, and satify with my decisions, I desmostrated what I am. I have a beautiful life, and my life always is with laugh, laugh, I am creazy, and I love to be creazy, my personality is unique. and i like that, so I feel very happy.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,2.8142867,2.6720634,2.987324,2.7782776,2.5758803,2.6799493,2.4280722,2.5988698,2.8251798,2.560611,2.7673163,2.2675354,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.5,544,18,0.3161764705882353,30.22222222222222,12,3,"{'tattoo', 'feign', 'mini'}"
D0CC47FFC293,"To have a good life we need to have a good way of think, it has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life. I'm agree with that statement because a positive attitude make you a better person, and makes your life easy, with a positive attitude your been optimistic and that is very importan during hard times in life. There are a lot of importants reason why it is important to have a positive attitude.

A positive attitude is the key to succes in life because you will have a good relationship with people. People like to be around a person that has a good attitude and is optimistic because they know that you are always going to try to help others and you are going to keep a good attitude during adversities, also if you have a good attitude people will know that they can count on you. You can give people good advices as well as a constructive opinions. Conversly if you have a negative attitude you are going to transmit a bad energy, and people will stay away from you. That's why is very important to have a good attitude because you are going to be surround with people that has a positive attitude too.

Also a positive attitude is important because it will help you to solve problems easily. If you are calm and keep a positive attitude during problems you will find a better solution for problems. If you are positive you will try to think in a way to solve the problem without stressing too much. Also if you have a positive attitude you will not give up easily during hard times. People who have a negative attitude always struggle when solving problems, because they think that maybe the problem does not have solution or if it has is to hard to solve it. Negative people always focus on the bad side of things that's why it is very hard for them to handle problems. Thereby is important to keep a positive attitude, no only because it will help you, but also because you will be more happy.

Another reason why is important to have a positive attitude and why I think is the key to succes in life is because I have seem that people who have a positive attitude are more happy than people that have a negative attitude because they stress for little things that happen , positive people are always trying to see the good side of things, they know everything that happen, happen for a reason and that everything has solution, we just need to look for a way to solve it. People with positive attitude always make better choices than someone negative. For example; The majority of the people with negative attitude give up when they don't reach what they want instead of strive their goal. Largely people with positive attitude always keep going and fighting for their goals until they reach it.

In conclusion a positive attitude is very important to be successful because, it will help you to make a strong relationship with people. Also it is important because you will always find a way to solve conflicts, if you keep a good attitude you also are going to make good chices. You are going to be happier and live peaceful because you are not going to stress about everything . Your friends, family and coleagues will know that they can count on you because you are a reasonable person.

47261D6E0F08,"Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something?. We accomplish excellent grades at school by studying , at sports by practicing everyday and never giving up to become an amazing player, and at work by learning and giving a lot of effort to realize our goals.

First of all, students stay after school or ask for a raise pass to study more about the subject they have a test or quiz.

In the actuality, there is a lot of schools from South America like Peru, Chile, Bolivia, etc. that do not have after school or raise pass for students to study more. Some students have to pay approximate 30 dollars per hour for a personal teacher to help them at home. Students from South America do not have the facility to study with their teachers without paying for extra classes. Another example, when I came to United States, there was a day that I had an important test, and I did not know nothing about the topic. So, I stayed after school with my teacher, and we practiced a lot. When I took the test, I answered all the questions without problem. The next day, my teacher gave me back the test and I was the highest grade of the class. That made me stayed more often at school with my teachers to study different classes. Furthermore, to get good grades, students have to do homework, projects, and participate a lot in class.

Secondly, it is important for people that want to get better at sports to practice everyday to become an excellent player.

Additionally, people success in sports, when they never give up and try to learn by their mistakes. When I was in Generic_City, at school I was part of a volleyball team, and we played against another school. That day, I was not ready to play with the other school. My team lost the game because I did not played good. I did not want to play anymore, because I was scared of losing again. But I did not give up because I was fascinated with this sport and

I kept practicing and becoming better at volleyball.

I know that the best way to success at sports is practicing all the time, and never give up in something that you love. I learned that if I stayed in inactivity, and do not practice, I would never become a good player in volleyball.

Finally, people accomplish at work when they do new projects to grow the company each day. Another reason is, people have to be responsible with their duties at work. Besides, if you want to get a higher level position, then you can do it by learning more about your job and showing your effort and hard working everyday. In this days, is hard to get a good and stable job because it requires effort and knowledge, but being active and always doing something to make a wonderful work will let you find an amazing job. By the other hand, being idle can give you bad consequences like, you can be fired, never find a job or never be successful in life.

I am sure that most people accomplish more when they study at school to get good grades, at sport when they practice and believe in themselves to become an extraordinary player, and at work when they learn and give a lot of effort to fulfill their goals.

First, Many people, like to play soccer because someone like to wond some cup, other like soccer to distracted his maind, other like soccer to live all problem in the field. I think soccer is the most game in the world becuse when you wond the game, you are will be excited when you take the cup with you hands. Someone like to wach the game and like when his team are wining the game.

Second, Some people don't like when his team is losting the game, some people are luck like angry when his team losted the game, I think people need to know soccer is to distract person, but the aficionate will put angry with the team, the people need to know, what the team don't will be wond every game, but the aficionate don't see that, the aficionate want what the team wond all the game.

Them, soccer player wee luck like happy when the game was finish, but the aficionate is angry because his team lost the game, some player talk with the aficnote and say to the aficionte, everyone need to know the team never will be wond all game; Everyone need to know that if you will be stay with the team you need to stay with in the bad, and the good too, but some aficionate stay winth the team only when the team wond the game. In the reason is that aficionate need to stay with the team everytime.

Inaddition, Some aficionate don'tcare if the team lost games, in the player apreceated when some aficionate don't say enithing if the team lost the game, in the team work hard and trie to wond all game, when the aficionate will stay happy with team, or with player do really goodjob in the game, in some player tell to the afocionate the team will be trie to wond the game for you aficionate thanks to stay with the tam.

Finally, the aficonate is happy with the team because the team wond the campion cup, but the reason is that team wond the game and champion cup is because some aficionate stay with the team every moment never lived the team, In the team never give up, but the team know when the team is happy or angry, but the team contune with season and play all the games.

Conclusion: I think an aficionate in the world, nee to stay happy with his team, but the aficinate don't see when his team trie to fo everything right and trie to wond the game .Other think aficionate nee to stay with his team in bad, nd good too. Some aficionate, say good bye to the team when the team lost some game in the season, but some one stay with team the aficionate will stay with team don'tcare id the team los the aficonathe will be stay winth team.",2.5,2.0,2.5,1.5,2.0,2.0,2.447023,2.3302639,2.6312406,2.3849518,2.1797109,2.2297907,3.0611055,2.2055259,3.1019917,2.4250371,1.892604,2.7769501,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,501,11,0.2574850299401197,45.54545454545455,28,7,"{'distract', 'id', 'tam', 'bye', 'soccer', 'wining', 'campion'}"
F9072F36ECE7,"Dear Business Manager.

First of all this essay is written with the meaning of what kind of occupations I would like to do as student, which is good to know that there is someone that is interested on helping students like me, also as student I would like to start by the right way and taking what is the best for me for example what is going to be a job which will make me feel comfortable to know that my qualities and my knowledge will play an important roll depending of the job that I might get.

To tell you more about what I like to do is simple and easy at the same time, it doesn't matter how hard something it gets for me because in the end I always end up pulling through, althought I like to think before make a choise because is always hard when I do stuffs at the very beginning with no concern or knowledge of what am I suppose to do.

In this case, as a beginner I get excited no matter what the work it might be, I can tell that I'm not afraid to begin with new chalenges. So one of the reasons you should invite me for job oportunities is because unlike the rest of my partners at school they don't have the spirit of a fighter like I do, because I always try to give it all I've got because I know this is my heart and like my dad told me ones if ""if you don't fight for it don't expect for the things that you want to come for you"", and to prove myself that I can be someone on this world having a good job and be respected for it,so I can be able to support myself and my family as well, work hard in every little single thing I do is what I have to make sure that I can be capable and responsible of doing it.

In the other hand let's say that at least for now I want to graduate from high school, then go to college to start a career of mechanic, because mechanic is the number one on my checklist in other words my favorite, however this is would it be a big opportunity if you actually choose me for the job opportunity, because as it is for me this is going to be a really good starting for me, after all I think I can show you what I mean by saying I don't give up because my father always told me when I was a little kid; no matter what happens after I had to give it all, never leave a little bit of what I could let on my effort, also because he is been a great example for me since I was a kid or since I remember my childhood. Instead of being a bad boy, he showed me what do I have to to with my values and things that really matter to me, so that is pretty much of what I can be capable of when it becomes to a responsibility.

Persistent is other word that goes with my personality, if you want someone who really want to do something when it becomes to work, I think I might have the qualities that you are looking for any kind of job. So that's my response to what you might be looking for, i just hope that you can choosr me, Thanks.

E433745B3F87,"Michelangelo the artist once said,

'' The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving mark.'' I agree with michelangelo statement because we want to aim our goal right, or we will ending up missing. However, there can be a better statement to explain this more. When people want to achieve their goal to be somone in life. It's like shotting a arrow to hit the middle, and aiming the goal we want. For example, to aim it at the middle you have to focus, believe, think, be positive, and let go of your arrow to aim your goal. Other people would like a better statement , and also a better example to go with it. There are mostly people that take it serious to aim for their goal to be success. However there are some other that don't really care and just try to aim for their goal, and ending up missing their shot towards the middle. Another example, is when people want to aim their goal they have to study , work hard, have faith, believe , take risk , be proud, and never giving up. But there's people that miss their one shot towards the middle. Because they are lazy, not prepared, not focus, negative, not giving effort, and not paying attention for what goal their aiming for , so basically they will end up missing their only shot. Third example, is people have to aim their goal just right not to high , and to low. The goal is to aim in the middle ,but Micheangelo is right in one part because you only have one arrow to make it th the middle. It's mostly saying you have one shot to aim for your goal without making any miskates. I could understand why Michelangelo said '' The greater danger for most of us is aming our goal target right in one shot.'' Because there are some people that would have to take some risks. For example, they are not a citizen , or they don't have any papers to work , don't understand english well, they have to leave love ones behind,

and get discriminated by their colors. And it makes it more difficult for some people to aim for their goal. For those reasons theirs fewest people's that end up missing there shot. But there are other people's that won't let this get in their way by taking the risk , and some of those risks come worth it at the end. For example , there are some people that get discriminated by how they look and their color ,but doesn't mean that they have to give up ,and point their arrow the wrong direction to miss their shoot to success. They have to show the others people that they can make their one shot towards the middle all because they study, work hard, put effort, being prepared, being positive and never giving up. These are my supporting details ,and reasons why i agree with Michelangelo the artist statement. However, I don't think that this is statement is the most greatest danger for all of us.

F1DF4F89F70D,"Do you think that too much oil in your food affect your health, or it improve the ability of how you work at school? I think food that contains too much oil makes you get sick and that's what we have right now, but others think different and they have their reasons too. Although some say that the school's cafeteria should not change their food because the food that they are offering right now is especially made to make students work better actually, the school's cafeteria should change their food because it gives students more variation to eat and by having a healthier food less students will get sick.

Those who think that the school's cafeteria should not change their food have their reasons. One reason is that the food that they are offering makes students work better; this is because it has a lot of oil. Scientific studies say that oil awake people, and make people do their usually activies better. Also, students who have their test after lunch, and they have eat something that contains a lot of oil; they tend to get better scores than those who didn't eat at lunch; this might be because some of them can't think with the stomach empty, or it can be because oil really helps them concentrate, who knows right. The oil food doesn't sound that bad, isn't? but I will tell you next what is what I think that is bad about it.

There are many people who think that the school's cafeteria should change their food. This is because they have their reasons, one reason is to make students eat healthier; this will help prevent students get sick. There are many sicknesses caused by oil, and one of them is cholesterol; cholesterol can kill people if you don't know how to take care of it. Also, by preventing students get sick they will not lose any day of school, and that will help them have good attendance and they will not get lost in their important classes. For example: Science, Math and History.

Another reason to change the cafeteria's food is that it will give more variation for students to eat. This might sound simple, but by giving them more variation to eat; students will feel more free to explore food that they don't know. Also, students will feel more comfortable as if they were at home because you know that when you are at home food variate and that makes it fun. moreover, Variation of food will attract those who are more likely to stay out of the cafeteria; maybe they don't like the food that we have right now, and they are hoping that the cafeteria change the food. I think that by changing the food in the cafeteria will make a good impact in the school.

In conclusion, I think that the principal of my school should change the cafeteria's food because the variation of food will make a good impact in students who don't like to eat at lucn right now, and it will also prevent the majority of students to get sick. Eventhough those who don't want to change the food had a good reasons; ""The food that we have right now is made to make students be more active"". I think that the reasons to change the food are more productive for the improvement of our school.

FE4E3BB2DAE1,"People really work on this this? or People knows the importance to be better every day? People didn't know the importance to learn more, like give to their mind more wisdom and they just conform with small pieces and

I very agree with this statement because it's true that if you dont learn more than you already know, you don't be able to be successful in life and I was wrong all the time and it's sad for me just realize that I waste a lot of time doing nothing and this question makes think a lot and the reason why is because I never think about to do something much better that I did already and sometimes if I have to do it, Im afraid to fail or do something wrong but small things do the difference and know something more that you already do it gives you more opportunities in life and you grow more.

Try something new that you never done before it's something scary for humans it doesn't matter the age or how brave you are,

if you had a lot difficulties doing it; probably you will be scare if you have to do it again even if you already know how to do it for example, I been working in a Japanese restaurant about one year and half and it was the first time for me working as a server and I was scare to do it and the reason why I decide to do it was the money, and I got surprise of myself because I made it and my boss was telling me that I was doing really good job and I felt so proud of my self because at that time my English wan't perfect and after I'm got problems with him about money and it was too much problems, so I decide get another job my friend told me that her boss was looking for new servers so I went to apply but the problem was when I saw the size of the restaurant and the different with the other restaurant was a lot and also when I saw the menu in mind I was saying "" You will fail""

I feel too bad that day, and all the progress was long and suffering for all the mistakes that I made but I made it one more time and today I thinking all that I went through it was't that much difficult and I'm not a master but I'm still learning.

Many people are conformist with their life and dont want to learn more and unfortunelly I'm include in that group of people and it happens to me that I fail many times because

I think already know everything even more than others for example, One day I was taking a Spanish test and felt confident about it because my first language is Spanish and I remember the majority of my classmates were studying for that test but wasn't and I fail the test because I saw questions that I never imagine that even exist and that was very important to get a credit so that day I learn that even if know many things is always good learn more.

In conclusion, you have to be better every day and know that is always more to learn every day, even if you know the stuff and always keep in your mind that try something new don't have to scare you because every human has the ability to learn and do the much that they want and the only obstacle you put it to your self.

FB73ABAB1D14,"Students should have the right to elect their classes that they want to take in school, because it's all about in how capable the students are or how much the students can learn if they have the chance to elect their classes. It's hard for some students to learn a class that it have been given to him/her. Some students are born with special skills, they can handle many things at the time but not all the teenagers and the kids have the same ability. People should think more about just giving students classes without consulting with them about what their class are going to be. Some student might not have the skills that are needed to take the class that it has been given or the student might struggle with the class that it has received, because they didn't had the chance to tell their teachers or parents what they were capable of.

However, students should be allow to elect a class they feel more comfortable of in their school, and all the schools should be aware of letting students pick the classes or activities that they want to do or they want to learn more about, because It has been proved by scientists and experts, that the ninety-five percent of the majority of the students who elect their classes have become successful in their education path because, students have developed different types of skills that are based in a careers that they want to do in their future, that it became easy for them to manage after all the experience they have gotten, after choosing something they liked while being in school.

The majority of students do not consider music or drama classes important for their education, it's something that you are inspired by to do. Music, art, and drama these classes can be a distraction for students not to focus in their school work and it might affect their education status. Most of the students from the age of ten years and up are still developing their brains and they can get easily distracted. Most of the parents in the

U.S they won't let their kids watch TV for more than thirty minutes, because they can create a habit and they will spend more of their time watching TV, playing video games and more.

In addition, for those students who are forced to take art or drama classes etc, this choices can lead teenagers or kids to fall into a level of depression, for not having the chance pick something they like to do in school. Parents and school teachers should let students know that they can also practice any sport in school, this method would keep students exercise and healthy. Overall, students should have the last word of what they want to learn in school and parents should be aware of that.

In my life experience, I have become successful in the things that I have done while being in school, because my parents always told to pick something that I would like from school, and I choose to practice sports and after choosing something that I considered good for me and my future, I received an scholarship for soccer. All this happened after my parents gave me the opportunity to decided what it was good for me and my future. I completely disagree with the people believing that students should be require to take music, drama, and art classes, because all of this might take all the good opportunities away from your child and it will become a distraction for them.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.810429,3.6776767,3.9016378,3.7744517,3.6278355,3.802476,4.077394,3.789102,4.156567,3.978624,3.9019175,3.68191,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,601,16,0.3660565723793677,37.5625,7,4,"{'distraction', 'video', 'wo', 'soccer'}"

This is usually the time that you are in your sports practice or music lesson, or even relax at home and watching TV. However, things are different now. you lost the option to go home after the normal school time, because the school is extending the school day hours. It is not fair for the student to force them to stay any longer than the regular school time, it can simply miss up the whole plain of students' after school activities. The school should not extending the school hours, because student might have activities and practice after school, and it is the right for students to choose to stay in school when the school is ended.

For example, I have a lot of after school activities, and I always schedule them by looking at the time where school ends. I usually have music lesson right after school, it will be not convenient for me If the school hours are extended. I have to reschedule them, and decides with my private teacher. I might not have the time for the class because my private teacher and I are both very busy. The extending of school hours have the possibility to make me not taking the music lessons,because the conflict of the time. It is absolutely not worth it because , none of the new stuff will be taught in the extended hours, and we will most likely have more homework than usual. If we have more homework and more hours at school, our grade will most likely decrease because since many activities are squeezed to a short chunk of time, we will have less time to do our homework.

In addition, It should be optional for students to stay on after school sections. However, there are people who have very few after school activities, and they are welling to stay in school. That is why school have after school sections.

Instead of extending normal school time, we should let students to go on after school sections because it is better for the student to manage their own time and it is more beneficial for them. Students can stay in school for two hours every day in the week after the normal school time. There are many options for students to choose. Students can choose to study with a teacher in certain subject or work in the library if they want to study. Students can also go to the gym and play sports or even join a club like drama. Any options that students choose is benefit for them because they are learning in different kinds of way which might be more helpful than their regular class. It is clear that when students have trubble or issue in a subject, it is better for them when they come to the teacher one on one after school, because it is easier for them to understand the problem and it is easier for the teacher to only explain to one person.

Over all, it is a bad diction to extending the school time. It will not help or benefit the students and it is a wast of time for the students. It more better for student that they go to their practice and after school activities or go to any after school sections. The student will be more beneficial and more welling to learn than go to their regular class for an extra one and a half hour.

Every country, every school, every teachers have teaching for students how to working together to playing games on assignment. And games can make for students likely work together to create atmosphere funny, if they working with a atmosphere new, they could be give some ideas faster and learning better. Why we need to teaching them the way like that? If we did not teaching the students working with a group, what happen will be?

Almost the students really like working alone than working with a group. Because they think they can give some idea bad, and they don't want somebody complain when they do something wrong. If parents or teachers don't teaching them working with a group and believe by them self, they will never successful on the way they are. When Bill Gate was young, him learning about software and computer, when him did not have more idea. Bill Gate told friends about working with him, Bill Gate said: We could be create something new about software and computer. After two years, they could be create the new computer and software. Five years later, Bill Gate become rich people in the world. If Bill Gate did not told friends working with him, than we never know about software and computer like him created that. Bill Gate said: If the war appears, you did not working together, your country will be lost.

Why we necessary to working with a group? Because working with a group might be make your love each other and understand when you work. When a group understand each other, they would be do some project better and always will be on time. Like a company they never have one people working in there, because one people could not be do some project better a group. Every people working in company, they never working with alone, because they don't know where you fail when you writing essay. That's why we need a group can fix your fail and make you do better in your job. When you working with a group, you can learning some ideas your friends talking and the way they working. Danial Williams Hale said: Everything you learn, everything you practice, it's would be help you some case.

If you like working with a group, you can learning skill about your friends, you will be easy to successful on the goals. Like playing games, they need a team working together, if one people in a team like working alone, they can make your team loser. If you like working with a group, you will be have more friends and second language if your friends from another country. If in the world, we don't working together, maybe the world war three will be occur and the peaceful never got in the world. And we will never know culture of another country.

In general, working a group can make students learning about how to work together and give an ideas best. And can be understand more about the life with people in group, can share problem and working better.

E0EBA1995BCB,"First impressions works as a normal form to react to a person, the impressions will depend how scary or funny it is, and how people feel in that moment. Impressions are almost impossible to change, they come instantly, people can not have control of it because first impressions come naturally from the human, the maind sends the first impressions when people are impressed, and people are not prepared to the first impressions. It is impossible to change.

First reason, impressions come naturally from people, they can not have control of it. For example, when people meet with other people, they automatically have impressions of the new people that they are meeting, do not matter what type of people they are, but the impressions naturally come. Second example, people usually move around the country to live or visit, every new place that they are arriving, the impressions come by itself. Third example, during the school year, the students are exploring more about the classes, they even have been not thinking about it, but they already have impressions what the classes talk about, and the students did not can change those first impressions about the classes.

Second reason, the maind has an important work on the first impressions, the mind sends the first impressions to you. For example, when people go to shopping to a marked, they are looking and comparing the prices from other marked. People are having impressions about the prices and their minds are working sending them impressions and also information from the other marked's prices. Second example, people who work on hospital, they are constantly seeing people with cancer, their minds are prepared to make impressions and send them without any difficulty. The type of impression depends how their minds are prepared to react on that situation. Third example, people who come to the U.S from other country normally they are having new impressions, their minds are having a big change. The mind is who make the biggest work to give the first impressions and adapt to the new type of live.

Third reason, people are not prepared to the first impressions that they have during they are discovering new things, it come by itself. For example, when people go to the cinema to see the new movie about the world, they do not have any idea about what is waiting for them, they just infer that the movie is about the world, but stating the movie they start to have impressions. the impressions come without notice them. Second example,when people got 18 years old, they are not prepared to do everything by himself, they start to have impressions on how hard if the life outside with more responsibilities and without their parents. Impressions always surprise people because they never prepare for it. Third example, people who are starting new job, they are learning how to do it. They are having impressions how the job is, they were not prepared for those impressions that they are having during they are learning the new job.

In conclusion, first impressions are almost impossible to change, because first impressions are naturally from the people, it come instantly as result of a new thing that people learn. And mind has an important work on the first impressions, the mind is who send the first impressions to the person. Also, people are not prepared to the first impressions, it come as a surprise.

BB0157B70CA5,"Homework can be hard most of the time, and you need someone to help you with it. Having an afterschool homework club can be fun and a good thing to do in school. An afterschool homework club can be good for the kids that don't get to finish their homework or don't understand the homework. On the other hand, we have the people that don't have time to do things after school.

An after school homework club would not be good for some of the students. People don't always have the time to do something after school. They have other things that they have to do like, practicing for a sport, dance, sing, learning an instrument it could be anything the problem is that they don't have enough time to do homework, even when they get home. An afterschool homework club is good for the kids that don't have nothing to do for the afternoon so they can stay and finish homework from that day or something that they need to finish.

I am one of those people who is against the afterschool homework club. Sometimes I need to go to preactice, so I don't have time to finish my homework but, I try my best to finish it and turn in the homework the next day. Teachers might don't have the time to stay after school too, because they have things to do like if they have a pet they have to give it food so it won't starve or have kids and they need to take care of them so nothing bad happens to them. So that is another reason why they should not have afterschool homework club.

Most of the students won't have a ride back home because their parents can be working, they can be sick, or they are not home. I don't think the school is gonna take care of all the students that go to the afterschool homework club. That is another reason why afterschool homework club is not good. What if the kids get hungry while begin in the afterschool homework club. I don't think the school is going to have food. If the school is thinking about making a club they could make it at the last class so the students take that block so they can only do homework.

It would be better if the school makes the club at the last class of the day so the students take that block for only to finish homework. So the students that don't have time after school won't struggle about not finishing their homework at time because, they have other activities to do after school. It could be good too so everyone can take a little break of the day they had. This could help a lot so, if theachers have things to do like, grade papers or homework to check they can take that block to do all of that.

Another good idea could be, that they can make the club at fist block, at the start of the day, like if one of the students never did their homework last night they still have time to finish it in the morning before they go to class. My favorite one was the one in the last class because, everyone gets a little break even the teachers.

There is so much about the ocean that we don't know about. About 5% of the ocean is discovered and our earth is made of 75% water and 25% land.

Marine biology is a job were you work with animals. there is so much you could do as a marine biologist. for example, you could swim with animals and collect data, you would work in a lab to find cures with animals, you could even not directly with animals but research about them.

The ocean is an amazing place and is full of magnificent creatures. i would love to swim with sea life and help them in any way i can. if i see an animals caught in a net. I would try and save it. If there were animals in a bad situation such as injured, harmed, caught. I would help it. so many animals are killed every year. either for clothes, food, wild fire, pollution, loss of habitat, etc. over 700,000 thousand animals are killed every year. that includes sea life and land life. So many animals that are endangered like the black rhino. the great white shark, etc just from poaching. sharks are hunted for their fins and then just tossed back into the ocean to die. same goes for the black rhino. they are hunted for there horns and then just left to die. i want to accomplish saving some animals when i grow up.

In the ocean coral reefs are dyeing because of people and habitat distraction. some people think that coral reefs are just rocks growing out of other rocks but they are actually animals and they are living and breathing just like us. maybe they dont have noses like us they are animals and they should be treated like animals. in ten years we would have lost 100% of our coral reefs. That doesnt mean that all the coral reefs are gone it means that there wouldnt be enough coral reefs are a good habitat. Animals need coral reefs to live in and hide from predators like bigger fish.

So many animals died from plastic just drifting in the ocean. there are more than 1 million plastic being dumped into the ocean each year. Sea life dies from plastic by getting stuck in it or eating since its not biodegradable. In the future i want to help sea life with all the plastic and at least help out with it. a lot of animals even get stuff and grow up with plastic stuck on them or in them. there is this turtle when it got caught in a tip tie. the tip tie was stuck around its shell and it couldnt get out so it just grew around it and deformed the shell. when helpers saw the turtle they took the zip tie off of the turtle and the the turtle was free but its shell was still deformed from the zip tie. when people are recycling they should at least up the bottle holders so if it does get in the sea and a animal finds it. it is less likely to get stuck in it. turtles eat jellyfish so when there is a plastic bag floating in the ocean. the turtle thinks its a jellyfish and eats it. after some time the turtle might die because it cant digest the plastic.

i want to accomplish visiting the ocean and go diving, snorkeling, touch wild life and help out with injured animals.

FB4D3D883D49,"Cellphones has already taken place of your calendar don't let him take place of your family. Some people think cell phones should be allowed in school but other says it is just destruction. Cell phones shouldn't be allowed in school because it is destruction,increase cheating, and less use of dictionary.

Firstly, cell phone is destruction. For example the one person I know was always on her phone. Moreover as her phone vibrate she just open the phone and start checking messages. As result she was not distracting herself but also class and teacher. Later on due to this habit she couldn't pass SOL.Because phone was destruction for her. Last year one of my friend didn,t uses much phone in the first quarter she got really good grade. Furthermore in second quarter she starting using cell phones more. Moreover in school she do all her work in rush so that she could have more time for cell phones. As a result her grade starting getting worst she ended up felling her both SOL.In her first quarter she has six A and one B but in fourth quarter she have five A,one B ,and one D.Furthermore one of person couldn't pass SOL and grades also go really worst.

Secondly,cell phones is not only destruction but also increases cheating. For example one of my friend whenever give test she take picture and send question to other student. The teacher make same test for both classes. Furthermore she can help them by giving them answers in test but in SOL

she couldn't help them. As a result they will end up might be felling SOL.Moreover one of person was giving a final exam in school she was also texting one of her friend all the answers and the answers she didn't know she was also using Google for them. Most of the question was about vocabulary she was just searching vocabulary and writing on final exam. Cell phones are not only increasing cheating but also student thinks they are helping others which is wrong. The both person was doing wrong one of them was sending question to her friends other was searching from Google.

Thirdly,cell phones is destruction,moreover increase cheating furthermore there is less use of dictionary. For example one of my friend prefer searching from phone rather than using dictionary. The main reason for using cellphones instead of dictionary was because from dictionary you have to find a word it take more time than cell phones. Furthermore in cell phones you just have to type a word and cell phones will give you meaning ,and synonyms. Moreover one of my friend always uses phone for searching a word meaning she never use paper dictionary but in SOL they didn't allow you to use phone. As a result she struggle using paper dictionary. People want easy way to do things that is why they uses cell phones instead of using dictionary.

In conclusion, some people think cell phones are helpful in education but other thinks it is destruction. Cell phones are not helpful in education because it is destruction for students,increase cheating,and less use of dictionary .Students are keep checking on their phone. Cell phones is also increasing cheating student text test question to each other also can search from Google. Cell phones are also taking away people paper dictionary from student , student really struggle when they go for testing and cell phones are not allowed.

If the student offer distance learning, First he must have to talk to his counsoler about doing classes online and disscus with her about he can stay home and do the classes online. Second, the students have to take test before they do the classes online because the teachers or another people from the school can see if he really is going to do the work at home and be prepaed for all the work that the teacher will give to him/students. Finally, the teachers will see and talk to his counsoler or administrator if they do good in the test and see if they can saty at home and do the classes online also the teacher should give a recomendation to the students if they have to take classes online.

The students will have some benefits if they take classes online, First, the students obiasly will have benefit because they will be doing all work at home and they can ask for help to his/her brothers or sister at home and they can help to do the work and if they have a test in the class that he is taking he will pass because he can see the notes or some works that he finished before. Second, They will have benefit because they are not going to school and he can go out during the day and also do the work when they're out. Finally, Students also will have benefit because they can do the work whenever they want bacuse if they have the classes online at the computers is more easier for example, if they only have to take notes they only can see another attachment of the same thing and if they have a test they will see the notes or another paper about the test.

Students will have benefits with the grades. Firts, the students will have good grades because they will have a lot of time do the work that is assigment for the next day or the same day and they will be concentrate because they are going to be alone at home. Second, The students will have a lot of benefit in that because they can see some work abouth the assigment and have a 100 points in the assigment or if they have a project that the students who are in the school they only will have a hour to do it because the others teacher will give a lot of homework to them but the student whp is taking classes online he will have a lot of work too bute he will have all the day to do it or the next day.

In conclusion they can't take classes online because they will have a lot of benefits that the students who is going to school and they can sleep a lot and the regular student has to wake up early and they can't have benefit with grades or other benefits,

As a student I can say that I agree with this ""benefit"" but in this case I don't agree with making school two hours longer than usual for some students spending eight hours in school is consider to be enough becuase people get exhausted by spending most of the day sitting in a classroom.

These reasons of why people gets to be too tired to stay up during class, imagine having to spend two additional hours in school just to have a three day weekend which might seems good but it really doesn't.

Spending two hours more than usual for four days it just a way to still using energy even though people think they are saving energy but they really are not doing any better, let's use this as a example: the two hours we are using extra for the four day it still makes up for the eight hours we are losing for the fifth day of class. The extra two hours of Monday-Thursday sum to be eight hours that people still use the energy, which means they aren't really saving energy

Example number 1: my friend Generic_Name loves the idea to have a four day school because this means that he will have a extra day to do homework and to spend time with his girlfriend Generic_Name. For him this new programs works perfectly and is an advantage for him.

Example number 2: My boyfriend Generic_Name loves to study but he does not agree with this new idea because he has sports to do after school for like about 2 hours of training for the basketball team in our school and then after that he works for 4 hours to help his mom with his car insurance which means that he won't get enough to sleep at night because after he gets home from work he has to do homework so we won't have to turn in it late. Like him there is a lot of more students in the same situation. Who does thing sacrifies to help their parents to make the payments.

However, teacher's opinion matter too and they will be tired of speaking ten straight hours too, remember that they aren't robots who are just set up by the government. This means that they might not even agree with this new idea of making school loger for students and teachers.

My school should not follow this model because they should think in everybody's benefits including teachers and students plus the staff of every department in the school's main office to make a fair decision for everyone in school. We don't know if this new adaptation will work in the schooling system which we don't have guarantee of this idea working well for us as a community. Consideranting that this program is working for some business that have adopted this new schedule might not work for us as a High School because here we have differents actitvities that the people in businees companies doesn't have, which make us a different environment than the business.

75DAA54880C1,"The author Ralph Emerson wrote, '' To be yourself in a world that is constlantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.'' I totally agree with Emerson's statement because be something else is not the most greatest accomplishment that you can do, the most important accomplishment that you can do in this big worl is always be yourself, be humble about everything, be kind with others, and never change the person that you really are.

First, bring humble is one of the most important thing that we always need to have no matter what. Being humble can take you to the top, to be successful in the life. For example, Marisela de Montecristo, is a salvadorian beauty queen, who wob the title of Miss Universe last year and Nuestra Belleza Latina in 2013. Marisela grow up very poor, but when she was 10 years old, she emigrated with her mom to this country looking for a better life, however, when she came here she went to the school, she learned English, and she did graduated in social communication. In 2013 she decided to compete in a reality show that is called '' Nuestra Belleza Latina '' and she won, and with all the money that she won, she decided to founded an own restaurant for her mom in Las Vegas, Nevada. Six years latter, she decided to compite for Miss Universe El Salvador 2018, where she resulted the winner. That year she went to Thailand to compite for the title of Miss Universe. Now she is a famous person and she have her own foundation that helps people in countries around the world like Africa, El Salvador, Mexico, Philipines. Also she is modeling in differents countries like Paris, Spain, and Great Britain, but above all this things that shes is doing, she always still humble. In one interview with Telemundo, she said that being humble is the key of being successful in the live, and I totally agree with her.

Second, be kind with others is something that defined you as a good person, because people love when someone is really interesting in help others. For example, I think that we should be kind with others, help others, because we never know when we going to need help of these people, in addition, being kind is other accomplishment that you can do in this life, and is something that you can feel proud of be.

Third, never change who you really are for something passenger or for something that can not give you happiness, because be yourself is the most important thing that you can do in this big world. For example, my mom told me that being myself is the only thing that can make the difference of me between everyone, she also told me that being gay is not a hindrance to triumphing in my life, because with effort, dedication, and persistence I can do many things in my life, without necessity of change the person who I am.

To finish, be yourself is the only and the best thing you can do in your life. There is not other way to be happy and to demostrated to the world that you don't have to be something else to be successful and to make greatest accomplishment in your life, because the key always is going to be be yourself and be proud the person who you are.",3.5,3.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,3.3922184,3.2376382,3.4904633,3.3246765,3.1052616,3.289946,3.1444163,2.5478377,3.330776,2.9919276,2.6300347,2.003497,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,571,18,0.3835376532399299,31.72222222222222,23,10,"{'modeling', 'mom', 'emigrated', 'shes', 'hindrance', '2018', '2013', '10', 'triumphing', 'salvador'}"
946D8B23ECA6,"I agree with Albert Einstein when he said that imagination is more important than knowledge. within you knowledge comes you imagination. in that imagination you see that it will help you receive your knowledge from somewhere that you did imagined. even tho sometime you imagination can mess your Brain a little when you go ahead of yourself. Like when you think about a subject that takes you way over that your brain wont handle itself.

but mabey sometimes your knowledge can be more efficient than your imagination because your brain is acting more mature when it comes to obstacles that are difficult. your brain acts more when its come to a problem like that time you got stuck on that question on that math test you've taken. sometime even when you are reading a book. reading a book may help you vocabulary when you read.

but there're time when they both help each other. both knowledge and imagination can help when you construct something. mabey you wanted to built something but you had no idea what. thats why you have you imagination comes right on in to tell you many ideas on what to build. once you think of the build you knowledge is there to help out to figure out on how you should build it. your brain get all the knowledge to help to build that dimension of the building there s how both can work together,

but still there're some negative times when it come to imagination and knowledge. like that time you are felling a bit down and your imagination said that you cant find anything to make you happy. sometime when your imagination goes a bit to far like that time you play with friends when you were younger you can make thing a bit unfair with your imagination and can loose that friend. in middle school with that knowledge of yours can change many things on a test. you can do good or bad. but say you did good and you were the student that had the highest score but you friend go one of the lowest score but you bragged about it yo can also loose that friend.

imagen if a 16 year old boy wanted a job. he may have not be the smartest but he has a few bad grades. either he will get a get a good job or he'll stay jobless cause if how much knowledge he had since he does no study hard enough. so other students may have better knowledge and have received the job they have wanted. mabey t he 16 year old boy needed the job to pay for food but he had to ask all his friend to buy food since he had no ob nor the money. so in the future he became homeless because he had to pay the money back to the friends he had cause he needed money.

young children have the most imagination since they have nothing to expect. but at night children think they see monster are on closets and want to have their mom and dad to come see it for themselves but their parents say that there are no monsters. later the night they start hearing noises but cant tell were its coming from so they scream mom dad again because the child thought there was still a monster in the room. but the parents still say that there are still no monster in the room. later on the child starts to think that there it still a monster so the child went on outside the room and notice that it was no monster it was just their parent just making noise just to scare their child just for fun.",2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.9032152,2.785409,3.0987372,2.9461188,2.7183344,2.769701,2.9652574,2.955203,3.5205479,3.2904093,2.5639837,2.6537201,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,628,31,0.3789808917197452,20.258064516129032,9,14,"{'mom', 'scare', '16', 'monsters', 'felling', 'jobless', 'smartest', 'closets', 'homeless', 'cant', 'tho', 'wont', 'yo', 'bragged'}"
2B66CE2870AD,"John Lubbock is a British naturalist and politician that wrote a quote saying ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make"". When saying this you have some opinions about it because your past can also make up your character and who you might become later on in the future. Why should we let your character take control of us, we have most of the control by the actions we take in our life. For example your parents were very abusive, and somehow your going to be that way to no its going to make you stronger and built your character up more then it was before. We have a choice to make up our character like some people will say ""oh shes mean'', or ""why wont she share'' and its not her character maybe its her personality. You yourself built up your character and no one has to like it it but only you because at the end of the day all you have is yourself nobody else which is better then having someone judge you. No one can judge a book by its cover until they get to know who you really are and where you came from,your character can built you up and leave a legacy behind and you wont even know it because people will be proud of how you built your character up and ask ""how is she so strong ?"", ""how did she grow up to be independent?"". Once you tell them how strong you are and how your doing and the steps you took theyll be proud of you, because only you have control of how you can find your character traits.

No one can really know for sure what makes up their chachater just by saying ""oh yea I've done it before"" Lets say someone in your family died because of their sickness and you spend all those days being depressed and in denial that they are gone but guess what ? You are going to built yourself up and make them proud of whop they raised and who stood by their side and everyday your going to try and make every second count just to make them see how great your handling everything even if sometimes you might get sad here and there but,your still pushing through which is making your character stronger then your seeing it yourself. There are so many times in everyone life were they doubt themselves and want to give up because they think they arent capable of doing something but when youve realized from what you've accomplish the world doesnt seem so scary anymore, your brain will trick and say to you that you cant do it thats impossible and all these negative saying but, why should you focus on that so much thats not getting you through life its just bringing you down and you know that your character isnt meant for that its to push you and get you through all these brick walls that life throws at you only you can knock them down. So dont stop yourself from making a choice you know is right go with your gut and let your heart show you the ways dont let nothing in life stop you from what people think is impossible make it possible stand yourself out, make your character stand out because you are different no matter what.

Your life isnt a pick and choose its what you think is best and fits for you so the saying goes ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make"", its your life have fun with it and make everything you do in life built up your character.

EFBD506FC8F2,"Select me to visit your company It would be a great opportunity to learn more about this job, but also is going to help me to have better skills in what I do. I could easily write about my six years of experience in this area, and you would see that I could ""qualify"" for this visit, but I don't want you to select for those reasons; working in a TV Production company has always been my dream since I was a kid.

I was a little girl with a lot of energy, goals and really confident about myself, I enjoyed being in presentations, ceremonies or anything about being in front of the public. I kept growing, and a lot of people thought that I was going to forget about all this crazy dream to be in TV, but it wasn't like that, my interest was increasing more and more; I was still in my country, Generic_City, when I went for my first time to a news channel, the principal of my school in that moment selected me to make a commercial about a festival that we had, I'm not going to lie, I was scared and really nervous, but once I touched the microphone, I forgot all my fears, the employees of that place were so surprised, they told my teacher, ""how a 13 years old little girl can have a lot of talent? The way that she speaks make It see it so natural and easy to do it""

I would never forget those words, because It was there, when I realized, that all this was for me, ever since that one day, my principal asked me to do all the commercials for the school.

Two years later I had to move to a different school, and I had a big surprise, this school had way more opportunities to be successful in this area; the owner of the school saw my potential in the way I speak, and yes, he asked me to do every ceremony and commercials during the whole school year. But that was not enough for me, I wanted to learn more, so I stared to used professional cameras and make homemade videos to practice a little big more; that same year my family decided to move to the United States. I was really sad, no only for my family and friends, also, I didn't know If coming to America would change my dream,

everything was different, traditions, school and most important, the language. This change was not going to change what I like to do, I stared taking this class called: ""TV and Media Production"" and I felt like coming back to home, everything that I love to do, was right there, I learned how to editing videos, how to record professionally and take all I know, to a whole different level; couples moths in this country and I already had the opportunity to being in different news channels,video for the school and they loved how I did it, and I don't have to think a lot to know that this is what I want to as a career.

These are just some of the reasons why you should select me to visit and learn more about your company, I know you may have more applications of students with better grades and experience than me, but no all of them have the passion and enthusiast that I have, because this wouldn't be just a job, I would be a the biggest accomplishment for me.",4.0,2.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5835142,3.4056478,3.6949987,3.5648537,3.3787303,3.4484248,3.3250477,2.9064822,3.4677203,2.955722,2.5789695,2.8990803,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,597,10,0.3936348408710218,59.7,4,6,"{'13', 'moths', 'enthusiast', 'video', 'microphone', 'videos'}"
22F16C83DE10,"Students Summer Break Ideas

Most of students like to enjoy their summer vacation,but some educators feel like summer vacation is too long. Students and Adults decided to come up with different set of ideas to make summer break not long.. Some of the students are fine with having 2 or 3 months of summer break,and some people argue that there should be a year-round schools. A year- round school is were there would be 3- 4 week break in summer, a longer winter break,and a week off in spring and fall. These were the overall ideas that both students an Adults choose.

My personal opinion is that i would go with the year- round school because it would only take a year that students would go to school and have a shorter summer and a longer winter break. The reason why i choose this was because i prefer having a longer winter break. why? you may ask , having a longer winter break wil make students not lose a lot of school because in most part of the United States snows a lot. About 75% of parents have called in school saying that their children is sick and will not be able to go. These type of excuses can cause students lower their education and making up the work of days they haved missed. Instead of the founder of school saying their would be an ""2 hour delay"" or ""schools are close"" . Students can just stay home while having their winter break and not worrying about if they are going to school or not.

Having a shorter summer break can help bring students come back to school with a positive energy and a fresh start. Since summer break won't be long studens won't forget what they haved learned. Students are likely to fail if they would have have a really long break this is the reason why students forget what teachers haved taught them. Teenagers are likely to be more tired during the winter instead of summer this is why students are mostly tardy or absent. Even though i prefer having a shorter summer break, i still rely of the students that choose to have a longer break because it is fun to be able to go out when the weather is warm but at the same time i feel like is better having a longer break in the winter because is safer staying home when it gets really cold and when it snows.

Schools that are in the middle recontructing have to allow students take their classes out in the trailers. Even though public schools don't close when it snows a little they still have to reconsider. Some schools are constucting and students have to walk to one trailer to another to get to their class this why i like the idea of having a week off during fall and also when it's spring break ,It gets a bit cold and in some areas it already starts to snow. Having fall and spring break can bring students get their week off and take some time off before they have their SOL. It can also help refersh their brain and can start studying to be able to pass their upcoming tests.

My final conclusion is that the year-round schools sound like a good idea. It can really help students manage a lot with their education and also responsibilities. It can also help teachers not being stressed because they can also take their days off. School won't be that stressing if it were to take this idea. All of these were my own personal opinions.

16DEF72E220A,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. But I don't think that it would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Because, there are many reasons that the students could not able to learn home by yourself in online; which are that some problems, and communicating. Also there are more position to I disagree and agree with this argument.

Firstable, I think the students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, it would not benefit for the studehts, because of the students could have some question that they don't know. And if someone who dont' teach with them, they cannot learn that more understable. And they migth cannot catch up their late works, because of they don't help anybody. I have an examples of that the girl who has taken an online classes, and she didn't go to the school, because she thought, the online class is better than to learn subjects and it doesn't have to do that everyday and she can study her subject whenever day she could. But she have to her exam in the school, and she didn't study as well as can't catch up her study work. Now she stopped to take an online class in the home and go to school. So, in my opinion, even thought the online class is giving you as more free time but if you can't study by yourself, It couldn't help you that learn.

Also, the students can't communicate with other students. It means that the student can't study with other students that they can't make some friends and could not be an active just like some other students. Also, it will be impact their behaviour that they'll be more lonely. Because the students behaivior is always changing and easy to get used to their environment, especially the high school students. Therefore, i disagree to attend classes from home by way of the online and video conferencing benefit for the students.

On the other hand, the online class is not really useless thing that for the students. Of course, It should be has some advantegious way to attend online and video class, which are it helps that the students could be more mature and more focusing on their work. And they have more free time because the student doesn't have to this everyday as a school, they can do that whatever time to working on it. So, we don't have to hold one point of view, we should try that two other sides. For examples, the every students are different way to study, we don't have to demand to do only one way,

they might be more interest with the online, video class and the other students could be more enjoy to attend this class. Consequently, every students who enjoy that much, they could take that class much easily to study in their home.

In conclusion, I think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, but not all of students, because they all have a different way to study and somehow the student will need some help to support their what they are studying. In that case, students might be trying to give up to study alone. Therefore, the student might think very well to thier option to to attend classes from the home.

C7CE778367F6,""" Why stay home bored out of your mind when there are enjoyable ways you can spend outdoors? ""

I think outdoors activities are more enjoyable then indoors activities because you can spend more time with family, spending more time exploring the world, and take time away from all those electronic devices. Being outdoors provides a wide variety of interesting ways to enjoy being outdoors for example going to the park where there awesome activities for the kids and parents, taking a stroll outside with you dog or family, and it can also be a stress reliever.

First, Family is important, and spending more time with family is important, because it allow you to get to know them. For example your mom and dad work really hard to affords all the stuff you need and you and your brothers and sisters are barely able to see them. On Saturdays and Sundays are the only time your able to see them and have quality time with them but you are to busy in your room chatting with friends a d doing your homework, but all you have to do is take a break and spend time with them. Going to the park with them , walking around, talking have a nice conversation without a rush, joking around are ways you can spend time with family. Having fun at a carnival or festival with your family, eating hot dogs, cotton candy , riding fun rides, you might even find your cousins there and also spend time with them. All of these are enjoyable ways you can spend with your family outdoors.

Secondly, spending more time with the outside world is an amazing experiences because it allows you to discover all the amazing living creatures, food, cultures, countries , other ways other people live, etc. It can be very enjoyable to explore for example you can go to South Africa there are amazing food, animals if you go to the zoo its amazing, and fun to do with family or friends or even alone. Exploring can also be fun you can go out meet people you can go to book fairs, concert from your favorite bands or singers, try out different restaurant, try something crazy like jumping from a cliff and going into the river, swimming with sharks or dolphins, you can meet people who might be with you your whole entire life, have connections with them, visiting a museum, a aquarium. There are fun ways you can explore the world with all these outdoors activities.

Thirdly, spending time away from electronics helps enjoys quality times with other for examples your family, friends,and it helps be more focus in school and homework. Humans have tendency to procrastinate and be like

"" oh i'm going to do my homework and this or that tomorrow I have so much stuff to do""

but at the same time stay on there phone for hours. Some people cant even have a decent conversation with family or spend time outdoors with their brothers and sister because they are too busy on their phone for hours. Parks, museums, and other places have good outdoors activities that helps humans stay away from technologies. There and millions of ways you can enjoy outdoors activities without being on your devices.

In conclusion, going to the park with your family and spending time together, visiting different countries, taking time away from your phone, and enjoying all the beautiful things this earth has, are enjoyable ways you can spend outdoors, all of the activities can also be a stress reliever, going to the park with your cousin and sibling are fun to do and are enjoyable time outside .",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5445008,3.3766065,3.637969,3.5413635,3.4032338,3.420948,4.470543,3.7932007,4.0269017,3.9329622,4.1822214,4.220723,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,610,19,0.3868852459016393,32.10526315789474,4,13,"{'sharks', 'mom', 'thirdly', 'homework', 'procrastinate', 'cant', 'aquarium', 'fairs', 'enjoyable', 'sibling', 'reliever', 'chatting', 'technologies'}"
F7CBE1D11BF8,"Is true self-esteem caused by self-confidence or is it caused by achievement, are people right about what they believe that; self-esteem is caused by self-confidence or is self-esteem caused by achievements? Self-esteem is caused by achievements, although some people may believe self-esteem is caused by ""self-confidence"". I personally believe, self-esteem is caused by someone's achievement. By personal experience my self-esteem is caused by my own achievements.

True self-esteem is caused by achievements for example: We can say, an employee at Chipotle has recently been elected ""employee of the month"". People may say "" what does that have to do with self-esteem?"" It does have to do with self-esteem because, that person has recently been elected employee of the month, and is being rewarded for his achievement of being elected employee of the month for his hard work. Although some people may believe that; self-esteem is caused by self-confidence. I personally still believe achievement is prior to self-confidence, and it's the cause of someone's self-esteem like; being elected employee of the month, that is one feeling of satisfaction that person had for being elected employee of the month.

Next, it is possible that self-esteem could be caused by self-confidence. For example: there may be students that can't start off their day learning without feeling confident about themselves. They may not want to learn, because they don't feel the positive energy or enough knowledge to be able to cope with how they're feeling that day; whether they want to learn or they don't want to learn. Also, for example: I have a friend who can't learn if she doesn't feel confident. She starts distracting others around her, she starts interrupting class, because it is hard for her to focus and learn when she doesn't feel confident. Although some people believe in praising a student's work to build self-esteem. I still believe in achievement being prior to self-confidence. Because in my opinion the second the student is done being praised; they will immediately go back to not feeling self-confident to start their day learning.

Finally, true self-esteem is profit to achievement. There is a vast of people around the world being praised for their achievements. Achievements include; If you're being praised for something good you've done like: getting a job, becoming employee of the month, helping someone by carrying their groceries to their car, if an elderly has tipped over in the street and need help getting up, these are the causes of true self-esteem. For example: Last year 2018 at my old school, Generic_school our cheer team felt true self-esteem to find out they had made it to finals. Making it to cheer-leading finals was a vast achievement for them, because it had been 5 years since our team had won finals.

In conclusion, true self-esteem is caused by achievement. By personal experience I can conclude that achievement plays a huge role in having self esteem, because my true self-esteem is caused by my own achievements, and due to others personal experience true self-esteem is caused by their achievement. Although some people may believe that; self-esteem is caused by ""self-confidence"". I personally believe, self-esteem is caused by someone's achievement.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.6176233,3.5291252,3.7390318,3.5812469,3.5623689,3.6150756,3.3654351,3.3481817,3.7084358,3.602486,3.7094603,3.3967705,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,540,26,0.3592592592592593,20.76923076923077,11,7,"{'rewarded', 'praising', '5', '2018', 'interrupting', 'groceries', 'distracting'}"
3CED6DDF77BE,"School districts should not offer programes that allow high school students to gradutade in three years instead of the traditional four years because elective courses are important as well as academic courses, the summer courses are expensive and parents should let the children to enjoy the summer.

Elective courses are important besides the academic courses. A student should collect the other knowledges also. Only academic courses are not gonna help him/her to be a good human being. Afterall, he/she has some hobbies in his/her life like cooking, painting, designes, dancing, singing. Think, a student is only studying because he/she wants to graduate earlier than the traditional four years. What will happen next? At the point he/she will be tired of life which is absolutely unfair. Maybe she/he has a very good artist. How can he/she expose? The answer is through electives. No matter what a person works with, if he/she doesn't like to do that work, it never last longer. So, elective is a way to make student happy and cheerful. When the academics make them tired, electives help them to get out from there.

Summer courses are expensive in some of the schools. Sometimes middle class family can't afford the courses fees. For this, the rich kids take the courses only. The poor kids stay behind. The poor kids can't afford the courses just because of money. Maybe they are more talented than the rich kids. They also should get that opportunity. Isn't it unfair for the poor students? Yes, it is. So, they shoudn't continue with this three years method. We should treat all the students equally.

Students should enjoy the whole summer by doing outside activities. Students usually have school 9am to 5pm. They spend their whole time in the school. How can they make themselves involve with outside world? Normally they can't in the regular school days. For this, governments make this rule to free the studnets in the summer so that they can enjoy outside activities. If they think about the summer courses, it's not possible to enjoy their summer honestly. A student leads a robotic life in usual school days. For mental health a person needs some free time or vacation. It's absolutely not possible for a person to lead a regular life everyday. Entertainment is important. A routined life, 9am to 5pm then returns to home, again homework. Life can not run like this. I understand that every parents want their child to be smarter than others. But it doesn't mean that they just have only one way to prove themselves by taking the summer course and entering college earlier. They can be a good artist or journalist. The parents should think about the children also. Not only about their academic abilty. There is a record in the United States that students attemp suicide because of study pressure. Isn't it shame for a country? A student is attempting suicide. why?

because he/she can't handle the pressure. Without life, what will you do with the education? Mental peace is important. So, for mental health a student has to enjoy the summer.

We have only one life to enjoy. Let's not waste it by thinking about academic career only. We have much things to do as well as academic. Just need to keep patience and walk with the flow.

BFEA2E7F1486,"To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment because at the day of today there's a lot people that doesn't want to accept the way that you are or you want to be. They will never be satisfied, they will judge you, they will talk bad things about you, but at the end it's just a obstacle that the life put in your way, so you can surpass it and finally find yourself and be how you are.

To be yourself in this actual world it's difficult for some people because sometimes they don't support the judges from other people and most of this people just decide to end with their life. For example the LGBT community get a lot of hate, judge and bad things from other people that is not part of it. People in this world just talk about others without thinking the pain that they can cause by saying just a few simple words. Other example is the people from other country that travel to another, there are people that are racist and make people feel that they are from another world, when they are actually they same, the only thing that change is the culture and language.

To be yourself in a world that is contantly trying to make you something else is one of the most important things that people have to achieve, to live the life better because you will never progress in your emotional life if you don't make people accept the way that you are.

For teenagers to be theirselves is most difficult because they are in a young age and sometimes they don't really know how they are or how they want to be, and when they finally find it, the hard part is coming. Then for older people, most of them don't care what people say about them, I have seen a lot of older people that dress and make to their selves what they want and I really like to see them because it makes me to be less insecure about myself, they just make me think a lot.

Live the life by showing how you are, the opinion of other people doesn't have to make you more insecure or make you think that if you do this or other things you will get judged or hated. You have to fight to achieve this because life is better if you do it, is better if you don't care about others comments, you will be more stronger than before if you fight with all this situations.

You will be more happy and will have a great life if you are yourself, you will be more certain about your opinions, decisions and actions. You can help other people to achieve this goal that is ""To be yourself"" because sometimes there is people that need from others to make a change in their life.

If you help them and they accept your help, they will be thankful to you because you help them a lot and you was with them, when nobody wasn't.

At the end of your days you will be really thankful to you because you live life the way that you are, not the way that others wanted you to be. You will think in all the things that you have to supported and achieved just to get your goal, to be who you are and at end you will knew that it wasn't hard. It was just obstacles that maked your life more stressful and harder but you did it.

400E5AA27067,"It has been said that first impressions are impossible to change, I disagree with this stiemant. The reason

I disagree with this is because first of all first impressions are a snap chat of who you are.

Second of all the more time you spend with a person the more likely that they will change there mind of who they thought you were from the first time they meet you. At this time of peride people are starting to get the idea that first impressions are't always correct, so they are willing to give a second chance.

First impressions are a snap chat of who you are, for me personally first impressions are always heard because based on the few second I spend talking to a person they will always think of me as that person specie if am never going to see them aging. Job interview is a big one because based on how you present your self at that moment of time will determan whether you get the job or not, and you might get nerves and act a sertine way that will not help you get the job even tho that's not who you really are. For example like a year ago I had soccer tryouts for a big soccer team the whole month I have been training and feeling good, but when the day came I was nerves because I never had the chance to tryout for a big team like that. I ended up not getting into the soccer team because the whole time I was worried what time the coaches will think of me and they were not impress with me the first, but this year I made it into the team the coaches liked me because I was much comfortable on the ball this time then last time and the coaches changed there mind about me . What am trying to say is first impressions are not impossible to change.

The more time you spend with a person the more likely that they will change there mind, Sometimes you will like person based on for the few seconds you seen them or talk to them, but then when you spend more time with me you come to find out that they are not as much as inserting as they seam. For example I had this kid in my class he was funny and seem inserting. but the more I got to now him i found out that he is funny when they are a group of people around him but when you talk to him one on one he is like a whole different person. This just goes to show that it is not just bad first impressions that are not impossible it's the good one's too.

People are starting to get the idea that first impressions are't always correct, Job are starting to understand that first impressions are not always correct for that reason they are willing to have two job interviews with. Sometimes it might be first on the phone than in person or just have two job interviews in person and I think that is a good idea spicily for people like me who are not good at first impressions.

inconclution,

Some people might say first impressions are impossible to change and I can see where they are coming from, but all am trying to say is the more time you spend with a person you are going to have more understanding of who they are. The only time I would say first impressions are almost impossible to change is if you are going to see the person just for one time and never see them aging. If that is the case than what ever the image of you they have that will just be it but be sides that first impressions are not impossible to change.",4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.1922727,3.1113505,3.3331723,3.2462072,3.0708532,3.0323682,3.7899477,3.252651,3.5529854,3.6026127,3.1359117,2.6765265,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,649,18,0.300462249614792,36.05555555555556,7,7,"{'inserting', 'tryout', 'spicily', 'specie', 'soccer', 'tryouts', 'tho'}"

I disagree imagination is more important that knowledge.

I disagree because, I think knowledge it's more important because, you have to knowledge after you imagine because, I think knowledge it'a more important because you have to knowledge. The situation to think really good if you dont due you can not think what it's gonna happen.

because if you only imagine you don't gonna knowledge good because, if you only imajinate and say the words after you knowledge the words you what to says. and if you knowledge first after think you can be able to due son tings.

If you gonna to due a story if you only imagine you can not be able to due because you have to Knowles the situation first after you think because son times you can get good imagination and you have to knowledge.

like for example if don't knowledge you don't gonna now were put tings to knowledge the situation were you gonna put things and the ca n be better.

I don't no what scientists Albert Einstein think and i gonna now what he thinks because, people have different opinion like how it's more better to they can use, and because persons have different ideas,like me i think then knowledge it's more important, then imagination but others people they can think it'snot because for people to see things it's different, because if the person am gonna write the story am gonna use the knowledge to knowledge, the situation better and make good story.

The knowledge it's like then a group because you have to search or knowledge to now what you gonna due because, if you only have in a imagination to what you gonna due that can work, like when you go to your job and you have to knowledge,what you gonna due for the day.

when you go to school and you go to science if you have to examine the a plant you have to knowledge the plant to now were you can star to examine the plant.

when you due sometimes you have to knowledge the situation,like for example,when a person quilled to another person, the police they have to knowledge,the scene and who was the criminal and knowledge the situation how died and who was .

some people think the imagination it's was first and it's more important would, I think the people see for different forms to due would a think some people it's right because, I see for different forms like when you imajinate it's like when you imajinate the things would you can have a picture in your minds like you can see pictures like were you what to put things.

but you can have im imajine in your mied but you have to knowledge first because i think if you knowleged because i feel more necesary to knowleged beause when you knowledged you can feel it's more easy or if you look like the pictures way it's more easy, because you see the things more specific en your miend.

it's alot ways to you can see things because for people some people looks diferets to others you can see more better in you way if you don't get.

He talk about how he grow up poor and barely had anything to eat or get though the day and how going to school was a big deal. He also told me how his brother and father died when he was six-eight, but he also told me how he came to America and how hard it was.

When my grandpa was born he was born poor. He had one brother a dad and a mom his dad did constructing and his mom most got everyone ready for school and tried to make everyone food. The closest school near my grandpa was 3.4miles away he had to go walking, but he went to anyway school he cared about his learning and he found it fun. It was a big deal to go to school where my grandpa lived or lived near by not many people get even get to go school at all it was that special.

My grandpa was only five when his father died his father was a man with a lot of problem. His father got him self into so much other people and gang. People looked for father but he kept low until one day he went to work and there were four people waiting for him he tried to run but he was to late because one of them shot him with gun they left him with three gun shot in his body laying on dirt he bleed out before the they could come and save him.

As for grandpa brother he got sick he said sick for two months my grandpa told me he was smart man he teach my grandpa how read and write better my grandpa said ""he the reason why he got such high grades in school"" when he got sick that when my grandpa tried to do everything for him so he can stay alive but back then medicine wasn't very good, and keep in mind we not in the u. s.a and it the year 1976 and if you did have that type of medicine it very expense. The most my grandpa and his mom can do is pray to god every night to get his blessing for his brother and his brother died in his sleep. They dug out a grave for him and everyone said there prayers his mother won't stop crying for one month but then she accept the fact he was dead.

It would be fun to work at the police station because you can travel to different countries and cities you have never been to. Therefore, you can explore from above when riding a air plane and you can meet different people. Also experience of what type of cultures people do in their country.

Working at the police station would be cool and super fun because I can work on fun cases, involving to ride different vehicles or going undercover and going places. Just imagine your manager assigned you to go to Korea and you stayed there for a few years. You have made new friends and learned the Korean language. You had to take Tae Kwan Do and you made it to black belt. However you still work with the U.S. police. And you also observe of what they do in Korea, for example, how they harvest rice and at what type of climate they need to be in or how the people eat their food and how younger children greet the older men and women. Also experience what people do in their specific culture and what laws they follow and things they need to respect. And also how they sell to get money.

Also working with police means you are not alone, you have teammates with you. They can also help you on cases that can be dangerous. Your teammates can be helpful and fun because they can help make wise decisions and on something risky, like you have their back and they have yours. They can also be help and caring/fun when you are stressed out and they try to make you feel better or trying to comfort you and not making you feel lonely.

You ate breakfast and you remembered you needed to finish on one of your assignments your manager had gave you. you felt even more sick.

She went to your bedroom noticed that you had been eating junk food all day because you had lots of your favorite corn chips and an empty box of pizza beside you.

You told her why you were so miserable and guilty for not finishing your assignment. She stoop up and told you that she was going to help you. You also stoop up lazily, but you felt excitement.

610FA0016255,"Self-esteem doesn't come from praise or achievement, In my opinion both of those are only ""supporters"" to recognize the person effort, all of about self steem really comes from ourselves, our thoughts, ideas and efforts we've done. Self-esteem is what to make you be,what you transmit, act or just to look like, that's why is really important to have that present beacuse evryone should have self-esteem.

Some people believe in praising a student's to build self-esteem, even if the work is not the student's best effort, also so meany people believe that praise given for deficient work undermines learning by lowering standars, I agree with this one because as humans we are, while more peole are praising us, we just will start to act maybe worngly because is too much attention.

Teachers might support students to get better as people also keep getting motivated while they're doing a test or classwork, sometimes with words to make them feel they are doing a great job but they shouldn't do that everyday because not everyone notices the value those actions has.

First, If for example there were 3 students who are very lazy but they start to do better things, the teacher will probably praise them because they made an ""effrort"" but if teachers start to do that everytime,students coul act as lack of attention even if they don't, and there is the problem, of course students must be more confident in orden to learn when they are making some efforts to do their work,however some of them just take advantege of that, when they just think because they have good grades they should to get an achievement or praises from others, even if they don't.

In addition, If in our own homes parents do teach us what's to have a good self-lesteem and how we have to be, we'll not need the approvetion ur opinion from other people and it will be enough because we'd already know how to act like, and just to think that we need an achievement or praising from someone to prove we're good on something, it's completetly wrong, you don't have to get an achievement to prove you're good on something you like it or enjoy to do.

The only thing we have to do is always make an effort, just prove to yourself you are good on something because you want to, not because you're waiting for an action from a person, also not everytime you have to get sometime to prove you are doing a good job bc you are not always to do a good job, beacuse nobody is perfect and everyone has a lot of mistakes, just do it for yourself.

Not always everything is gonna be super easy in life to us, sometimes you have to go through several situations that will make you grow as a person, every human've had self-esteem issues at least once and that's alright. I think we shouldn't depend on a opinion to get better each day for ourselves, we've to notice we are not perfect, we have mistakes and not everyone always will be cheering up us, we have to fail once or more and then just get up and keep going, with our skills and mistakes also knowing that not always we have to get something to prove our knowledged, that's where self-esteem comes from.",3.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0521116,2.8994992,3.2169306,3.0522227,2.8092194,2.8234472,2.7177532,2.6059349,3.0551155,2.4821813,2.4670033,2.6770678,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,587,9,0.4003407155025553,65.22222222222223,26,10,"{'praising', 'alright', 'undermines', 'transmit', '3', 'praises', 'classwork', 'cheering', 'deficient', 'meany'}"
A0D47C0DD67F,"Individuality is the idea of freedom of thoughs, but why we are concerned what other people think? Let's be honest everybody had copied at least one time in a test or quiz just because it was more eassy to coppy than being trying to remember the anwer that obviously you did not know. We own our thoughs, thus, we should do ours ideas not somebody else's ideas

In the book called ""Maria Magdalena"" based in the movie ""The Davinci code"" states the ideas of one individual who thalk about the true behind the story about Maria Magdalena ( Jesus' mother). To catholic people Jesus's mother is saintly. Their sanctuary, the church. To the author of the book ""Maria Magdalena"" she is just a lie's layer. On those old times there were many poor people who were opressing by the church, they sufer in the church's hands. The church killed to protect the true behind Maria Magdalena. On those times existed the crusades in spanish the ""cruzadas"" in which the church fought the protestants to convert them in their cristianity if they negated to accept it they killed them. The victims decide to follow their own beliefs and the consequence was the death. This is a good example of individuality similar to our way to live in the present. The politics want us to do what they want to their advantages opressing our rights just like the church did with the protestants during the crusades. The author of ""Maria Magdalena was very brave to wrote about those things. He was very successful because nobody used to talk about this, now they do. In this book he shared us a little part of what was to be different from the others and take their own decitions. Based on this I state that we can share our ideas of individuality and do not let our corrups politics to opress people's rights.

In the present we have a huge amount of successful guys because of individuality. The influential ideas of the past are not in our day to day anymore. Parents now teach their offspring to take their own decitions knowing the consequences of this. Now we, the tenageers, are more prepared to develop our ideas and beliefs. Constantly, my mom develop the ideas of individuality in our family. One year ago I decided to start to work, and I am very proud of my decittion.

I remember my first day of kinder garden, All the kids playing and runnig around the field. To be honest, I prefer being painting rather than be runnig for no reason. My art's teacher gave us draws made by her.""Ready to paint"" she used to say, but I was so rebel that I made my own draws just because I though her draws were so bored. I was a little girl taking individuality decitions and I did not know it

In my conclusion I am agree with individuality, If we want to spread the individuality, then we should start saying what we think, because the bravery of the unexpected ones, will persuade the shyness ones. Individuality can be hard but not impossible. We live in a world with influencers that try to persuade us to be like them. Do not choose the easy way. I prefer the hard way, so then I would be proud of my achievement just like Ralph waldo Emerson said: ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplisment""",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.2049077,3.0774946,3.368729,3.191465,2.9507499,2.9704773,3.2141497,3.3855171,3.642422,3.6141253,3.729466,3.1126218,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,592,31,0.4476351351351351,19.096774193548388,25,8,"{'mom', 'copied', 'crusades', 'shyness', 'kinder', 'negated', 'saintly', 'quiz'}"
A79D997C4B42,"Working with a group has more benefits then working alone because with a group you can all help each other and learn new things, also so people can be more social and you can get the work done faster and aso there can be some pressure . When you work alone it can get very boring and you may need help with something but also if you are working alone you can work at your own pace. With a group you may be pressure to finish something quicker but your teamates can help you with that. When someone is in a group they can act silly at times and give the teacher or the boss a headache but, when they focus they can get work done faster. Working with a group is not just for the work, it is for people to be social and so people can see how they act around other's. You can learn new things with other people that you did not already know or you can teach them something but at some point the whole group teaches everyone somehting new.

Working in a group you would probaly be pressured to stop being foolish and get your part done but if you have nice teamates then someone can help you with your part. Some people, perfer to work alone because they do not like to be pressured for no reason but in some ocasions those people are the one's to turn in late work or has incorrect information. In a group they correct you if you did not do something right and hellp you out if you ask for help and someone can help you becuase that's what a group is for to help each other learn new things. If a due date is coming up there can be so much pressure because maybe you have not even done your part or you are just lazy to do it some your teamates start to get mad at you and you do not know what to do.

Learning new things can be fun with a group because you might not be shy to ask questions so you learn new things and maybe someone else from your group learn that same thing as you. If the group learn's something new then they can use that thing in the future when they work alone or with a different group. Helping each other is one of the easiest way to get done with something but working alone you may take longer because you have to search up things and some times they do not know where to start.

Teachers put students in a group to see how they act around each other like if they act goofy or if they do not have self control. When working with a group there has to be self control because if the group is just being goofy then they would not get work done and they can get a bad grade and not work together in that class ever again. The teachers see how the students act and they see who should be with who and who should not be with someone. Working alone the teachers know that it will be quite and they would not know how the students act with friends around or a group.

Working together is way better then working alone because you become more social and not so much of a shy person. A group can also help you focus and have a good time all at once, also they can hep with having a good grade in that class because they helped you a lot. Students learn new things when they working with people and they might not be so shy. Working in a group has more benefits then working alone because working alone you have to do everything on your own and with a group they can all help.",3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.4707794,3.3956254,3.5863128,3.5571923,3.415974,3.3752642,3.292403,2.9289813,3.401776,3.0141604,3.1153638,3.1823301,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,656,21,0.2774390243902439,31.23809523809524,9,3,"{'hep', 'pressured', 'goofy'}"
2A2AE5FB899F,"One topic that is frequently debated today is, if the amount of work days should change to less then five days to four with the idea of conserve energy and resources. Many people think the school should reduce the day of school. Some people believe that is a good idea to conserve this value and important resources. I think this idea will not make a good change because many student will be affected with this idea they work after school, we will have less time to do wherever we want, and it is difficult to everybody to stay focus ten hours in the school.

To being,

just imagine all the students how work after school, everyone have a limit in our body's and mind's to do different activities every single day. If for the students how they don't work after school it is really difficult to stay on time with they homework, think about the student's that only get home and just change their cloths, maybe eat something at home or just wait for a break in the work. A lot of students have to pay their own food, clothes, and even a lot of them pay rent. If the school finish at six, they will have less time to make money to live, that is one of the big situations that a lot of teenagers live every day. Now think about the increment of the time in the school and all the effects that will have.

Therefore, our second reason is we will have less time to do wherever we want or wherever we need to do. If the school finish at six only in one hour or more, the night come out. If you want to play soccer on the grass you can't because is to dark, a lot of stores close early, if you want to buy something you couldn't because probably the stores are closed at that time. when we got home our parents probably are not even there, many of them have to work on night. we only will have four hour's to do at less something that we want to do or we need to do starting from six to teen with the idea of that is the time to go to sleep.

However, it is difficult to stay focus ten hours in the school. More time in the school, more time of homework or even more classes to take. We will have even less time to do any activity after school, because we will not have enough time to finish our work. With all the material that we have to finish we being to stress out and not doing good in the school.

In conclusion, the amount of day at school is not necessary to change to less them five days and steel the same time, everyone get tired and sometime everyone only need a rest to continue day by day. We can fiend better ways to conserves this values resources, reduce the time of work and school will not make a big change. what about all the companies that only want to make money and they don't even care about the resources in our planet just keep doing money and destruction. sleep well if one of the most important needs of our body. If we have less time in the afternoon to do ,what we need to do we will not go to sleep early. We can't follow the same routine every single day, after school we can: play soccer, go to shopping, go to the movies. A lot of different activities that we can do, like one famous quote say "" It is more time,then life "" . We could do better with more time on our hands.

Why it is important to work by your self? What are the beneficial? Think about it; Work by your self is better than work with a group for many reasons. Work on your own is more beneficial than work with a group learn more, more attention and good grades.

Generic_Name was a student that likes to go to school, he woke up every morning like a normal student does, but the thing is that Generic_Name do not likes is work on his own he prefer work in a group and not by its self because he likes to distract others by talking, playing,be in his phone instead on what he needs to focus on. The time keeps going and going. One day a wise person said

"" The time keeps going and going and wait for no body.''

There was another guy called Generic_Name. Generic_Name against work as a group because he knows that is a distraction and he don not likes to have bad grades. Generic_Name made a scientific experiment his experiment is based on the idea of work in a group or work alone. He talk with his teacher and explain his idea, the teacher agree with Generic_Name's idea. The teacher gives a worksheet to the student that were in the class and the teacher said you may work on your own or in a group.

The result was like Generic_Name thoughts were like, the students who work by them selves demonstrate good work, perfect scores and they did not took long time to finish the work and they were able to help others students. But the other group of students who choose work as group they show something different than the other students that work by them selves, they did not finish the work, others not even start the work between those groups was Generic_Name.

One day Generic_Name met Generic_Name at his house to play a video game. Generic_Name went to Generic_Name house and they start playing the game, while they are playing Generic_Name start ask a lot of question between those question he ask. Why you always work by your self? and not work in a group?

he laugh and answer the questions. I prefer work by my self because I easily distract with my friends, or I start talking with them and I do not finish any of my work. Generic_Name said something especial to Generic_Name. Understand this Generic_Name, work by your self is not the bad you learn, you prepare more your self, more instead of coping someones work. Think abut when a test, quiz, or an Sol comes up. Nobody will there to help you out and you do not know what to do. Please do not take mad at me I just want to help you, Generic_Name said don not worry, I appreciate the word that you said to me.

Generic_Name think over night the words that Generic_Name told him while they were playing, at the next day Generic_Name try to do what Generic_Name does and he found a big surprise that he can do a better job by its self, and time was passing and Generic_Name notice that his grades went up, have more time in home his teacher was surprise on the huge change that

Generic_Name had.

E18675E47293,"Dear,

School Board of Education

I personally disagree with the idea of adding one and a half hours of school. This is a terrible Idea and here are some reasons why I disagree so please grab a seat, relax, and take your time to read this. The first reason why there shouldn't be extra school hours is students will have to walk in the dark. The second reason is students will have less time for sports and other after school activities and also less time for family and friends. And finally students will be sick of having school for a such a long period of time and possibly stop going to school.

First of all not everyone is fortunate enough to have a ride to school but that doesen't mean that they can't go to school so they walk, but if the school board adds more school time students who walk will have to walk in the dark. Walking in the dark could be very dangerous because you don't know whats in front nor what's behind you and that could cause students not to go to school anymore because they will be scared of walking in the dark and feel unsafe. Another example of why it could be dangerous to walk in the dark is if someone is trying to cross the street and a car doesen't see them they'll probably get ran over and the school won't be responsible for the accident. Something that also is good to keep in mind is that if the school hours get changed and even if you try to avoid students from walking in the dark There's a cost. You'll have to put street lights and that could be very expensive, and the money could be used for educational purposes.

The second reason why extra school hours shouldn't be added is students won't have much time for sports or other after school activities. Sports and school are both important and they both should be equally balanced. So if school gets longer than maybe we'll have less time to see our family and friends. I remember when I did football practice was getting shorter and shorter because winter came, and during that time it was also raining a lot and snowing a lot so we missed a lot of games and practices, imagine if school was an hour and a half long, there wouldn't even be a football season at all.

The last reason why an extra hour and a half of school is a bad idea is because, a lot of students would get really sick of school and stay home or try to get suspended so that they don't have to got to school. We've all been in that situation where we don't want to go to school so we pretend we're sick, even I get tired of having to go to school every day, in fact I don't really want to be here right now but I have to. We've all tried to make our parents believe that we're sick, but that's a really old trick and parents already know it, and make us go to school. If students get more school time they just won't stand it and they'll start skipping school. But don't worry I won't do that.

In conclusion I think adding an extra hour and a half of school is a horrific idea, it will just cause more problems for the education system, students, parents, and even for our hard working teachers because they will have a more work and less time for themselves. But I also understand why you would want to add an extra hour of school.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,3.8202085,3.8224273,3.8996391,3.894305,3.9067888,3.7588167,3.293139,3.489915,3.7666183,3.3414016,3.3885317,3.4759197,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,638,21,0.3699059561128526,30.38095238095238,7,5,"{'horrific', 'wo', 'skipping', 'whats', 'unsafe'}"
E8795A1AA404,"When making life decisions it is good to ask someone for help then making the desicison yourself. Why is it better asking someone about the decision is because they could tell you either the desicison is good or they could tell you that don't do it and try to find a better idea. When making a life decision you have to think about the importance, how much it would cost me or whats the overall budget, and how its going to help me achieve in life.

When making life decisions it really matters on how its important to you or how its going to effect you in life. As life goes on do I think its going to help me improve what Im doing right now or is it going to drop me and destroy me for life. When making life decisions it also depends on how you're looking at that particular thing/object. Thats why you should ask someone else who is already doing that particular thing from before or ask someone who could give you an personal opinion/advice that would actually make you think if making this life decision is worth it or not.

When buying something big that will have a effect on my life i would have think about my budget and how am I going to afford this project without having any issues. So to do that I would ask someone for advice who is already doing that business or investment. When asking others for advice I would have to think about how they're going to respond and what they're going to say. This is why budget is also a very big thing when it comes to making life decisions is because I would have to pay that amount in order to have my business or investment stand out out the people around me.

Why would I have to ask someone to achieve my investment or business. To achieve my business i would have to ask someone for a advice who is already doing something similar to that. As Im asking for the opinion or the advice i would have to think how or what Im going to do to improve that decision. What hard work or thinking of mine or someone else's would have to go in that play to achieve the decision. As I would be achieving the decision I would have to see how Im being affected with it and how much pressure its putting on me. Why would I ask others for advice when I have brain and thats because they're going to have a different mind set from me. They probably think better than me or in some way where we both agree on the same fact to achieve the business or investment in a better way. This is why you should ask someone else for a advice or a opinion than going in alone in such a big decision that could impact your life in less than some days.

In conclusion to making life decisions it is a good idea to ask someone else for a advice than making the move alone. Its because someone else has a different mind set than you yourself. Thats why when making a life decision you should think about what things and what mind set you need to proceed with your investment or business. So the mains things you need is how important the investment or business is to me, How high or low my budget is, and what will I have to do to achieve this business/investment. For all these reasons you should always ask a person about their advice or opinion even though I might not listen to it but it doesn't hurt to ask. They'll give me the best advice or opinion even how big or little the investment/business is.",3.0,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.4441717,3.344973,3.5633166,3.476956,3.344568,3.3610468,3.1692867,3.7828894,3.6231244,3.5355988,3.5068202,2.9158776,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,647,25,0.3044822256568779,25.88,11,2,"{'mains', 'whats'}"

Good morning, we would like to visit your company because we are content to meet and know a little bit more about this job. We also would like you to show us how hard can a real job be. We want to be professional people, what is the why we want you to be our teacher in this new experience. We choose your workplace because we think it is a great place to start meeting about medicine. We would like to be a famous doctors as well as you are. We are also so excited to meet your workplace because some people doesn't have the opportunity to visit you and your clinic. We choose this job because we think it is a great job and also because you can save lives.

It will be a pleasure to meet your workplace. We want to be like you, be a famous person. We also would like to know a little bit more about how to be a fantastic doctor. We choose your workplace because of people told us that your clinic is the most amazing place to have an operation. We are five students that would like to know more about how to be a doctor and how to safe lives. I was thinking about if maybe you may be with us. We are asking if you can allow us to be in a operation with you ,or be watching how do you and the other doctors work in the clinic. We would like to be a great surgeons.

We think that your workplace will be a great starting to know more about how to do an operation. We would like to know how to become a doctor. Your clinic is always clean. We are asking if you can give us the approbation to visit your hospital. It will be a pleasure to meet you and your hospital because we just want to know how do you work, how do you control the clinic, how do you make an operation. We would like to be in an intensive room, even if it can be disturbing. We also choose this kind of job because it is great, even is sometimes doctors have to make hard decisions.

We know a little bit about medicine. We would like to be in your clinic one day because we want someone to show us the materials that the doctors use. In the school we do not have the resources to have these materials. We are actually studying to be the most knowing doctors becausewe want to be different from the others. You are the person who inspires us to be doctors. My dream is that in a future I can have my own clinic and hospital. Be able to say, "" I did it"". I know that it is a hard dream to follow. But if you gives us the chance to be in your hospital for one day. My dream will finally come true.

I swear that my life will be better if you let us be in there. Maybe you had a dream too, and I suppose that it was not easy to became a professional doctor. Was it? So can you please make my dream true and give me the first steep to be a professional person. I know is kind of hard to ask you to let us be in your clinic because I know you are a busy person. But I just want to know a little bit about medicine. I know you are a great surgeon, that is the why I am asking you to teach me. I know that it is not easy to be the hospital's manager and surgeon but there if you can. I'll too.

7EED34A43536,"Inside of each people always has the right and the wrong sides. That make they think if they should being themselves or not. If a person being themselves then they just want to do anything they know and do not care another person. However, they live in the modern world and have many things to worries. Although people have their own decision, people should not being themselves are great accomplishment because sometime they need to change and over time people have done the tasks they hate.

First of all, people have their own decision. So, we know that many people are accomplishment by their own decision but only for who are smart or brave challenge themselves. Some of them just live and do anything they like when they success. However, not being themselves should not change the physical world. For example, a man who has a dream that he can travel around the world. He always thinking about it but he can not. Because he know it is a modern world and has many things to do and worries. So, he put his dream on the side and focuses on the job. He hopes it will make his life better and can complete his dream later.

Also, sometime they need to change. Some people they never change their life, and they just live by the rules. Of course, they will feel boring and nonsense. They want to do with something else. For instance, a person who live with his family and he recognizes that he likes to become the doctor in the future because his family want it. Absolutely, he knows what he wants to do. But when he do this job for the long times and he feels that he does not has more interest. Everyday, he is so busy and he does not has times for his family and himself. So, he knows work to lives, not lives to work. After thinking about that, he wants to do the jobs that makes him comfortable and can enjoy the wonderful life.

In addition, over time people have done the tasks they hate. Task is the mission from the boss give them to completing. So, they force to finish it while they do not like. When they go out to work they need to follow all the rules of the life. Also, they can not do anything they like while living with their family before. For example, a trainee person who is young and do not have an experience in the job. Because he just graduation and he wants to become the employer in this company. So, he will manage by the marketing manager and he so happy about that. For the first day, the manager just wants him to do some work likes buy the coffee, copy papers... And he thinks it will better for the next day but the manager just gives him these jobs and no more. So, he hates it but he never give up because it is the rules of life. He recognizes that help him too much to create more skills and learn more experiences.

Thus, people should not being themselves are great accomplishment. So, people should not being themselves because they do not know exactly about themselves. Some people want to become another one to success. When they look at another people they can learn more lessons and experiences in life. Sometimes, they need to change to know the outside of the world have more fun than if they just stay at one place. Another lesson for that is something they hate is not mean they give up or not finish it because it is a part of testing in the life. Just do the best they can and maybe they can accomplishment if not being themselves.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.3121068,3.0621753,3.372186,3.1354308,2.8102994,3.2238934,3.4806445,3.0935605,3.6622472,3.1640368,2.5681581,3.5469146,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,634,42,0.3422712933753943,15.095238095238097,0,3,"{'hates', 'trainee', 'focuses'}"

After keep studying students should make positions on what they already are studying,thinking as a young age students are more creative with their minds and heart; Students should think as young age for a beneficial purpose,deciding on a career at a lower grade (8th) many societies et their students have this opportunities to choose their path and make changes on what they really want in their life,the're changing from a playful mind into a mind where teenagers starts to make decisions; In reality this is a path where they would finally decide what they want or could be do for being graduated as a honorable person, by doing the most of the students frequently found what they would do and could be doing on their future as a older person, as they think they organize them self and be more clear on their positions in life.

This could make a big change for teenagers, now they show they can make a more positive and strong decisions, to show that they make better decisions as a lower grade society could being tested for all middle schoolers and keep track on how do students on how they are getting ideas as they turn from Middle School to High School; Most of the students decide good careers and some of them great careers, but is not only about choosing a career is about what students could think as a teenager; having students deciding on what they think the're going to be success.

However, letting young kids think on what the're going to study as a career would not be the best because not all students want to keep studying before High School; it would be a waste of time and effort to give them a great opportunities to start thinking as young adults, this could not benefit all students because as they get into High School they keep changing careers and by the end of their 4 school year they didn't decide what career they want to take, most of students end up not enjoying their career and giving up deciding they shouldn't get that career and deciding to not finish the college. Therefore, students could not take a career they didn't want but if they know they could pass and be an excellent person, even in the career they didn't decide to take they could make even a better life in their future by choosing and changing the career they were thinking as they were at Middle School, they continue thinking on what they want until they reach what they're looking for in real life as a young adults.

By telling this students should see and think very carefully as parents understands their children and teachers helping their students how they could or might do to get that career on what they need to focus on, for society is really difficult to choose right ways hat might help students and which ones might not letting students choose sense their getting more knowledge they will increase the capacity to get into what career benefits them as students,there are many student that want a career and the society helps them with their courses a they are getting into High School, their final thoughts and knowledge finish for them and they should start to think more in what he career is and how they're going to deal with their job ",3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,2.986973,2.7965422,3.1729405,2.96546,2.6908126,2.8718057,3.7872107,3.7226927,4.4119062,4.3285303,3.9846172,3.6134937,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,662,6,0.3126888217522658,110.33333333333331,4,4,"{'whats', 'playful', '4', 'teenager'}"
E56D7CC27444,"Some people believe that glorifying a student's work might help them build self-steem, even when they have not put a lot of effort into it. They believe that students should be confidents in themselves in so they can learn. Others believe that glorifying a student's work that does not have a lot of effort into it lowers their levels of learning. They believe that in order to build self-steem they must complete achievements. I believe that students do not need others to praise their work, even when they did not put enough effort into it. It would make students think that what they did is perfect and that they do not need to work more on it or to do some more effort to achieve what they want. Although some people might not agree. They would think that it is a good thing to glorify students work only to make them feel confident. However, I firmly believe that students should put effort on what they do and that they do not need other people to praise their work only to make the feel confidents with themselves.

One reason I believe students do not need to be praised on their work is because it would only make them rely on what they have and not work to achieve more results. They will not do more of what they are capable of. In addition, they will not put more effort on what they need to do. They do not need others to praise their work only to make them feel confident with themselves. Finally, students will always need others to tell them what they did is amazing to raise their self-steem. This matters because there are people who still believe that praising a student's work will help them to be self-consident.

Second reason I believe that students do not need to other people to glorify their work is beacause it would make them think that everything they do is correct. Students will think that they are not capable of doing more than what they believe they can do. For example, they will always check their work with others only to feel confident with what they did. In addition, I think it is best to tell students that they need to be confident with themselves instead of praising their work. FInally, students do not need others to praise their work in order to be self-confident. This is importan because people have to tell students that they need to be self-confident, even when what they did has not their best effort.

Third reason I believe that achievement is the key to build self-steem is because only achieving what we want we can feel confident with ourselves. I think that to build self-steem we must put a lot of effort to achieve what we have to do. Students need to achieve what they have to do in order to be self-confident. This matters because students should know that they need to work hard and that means to put their best effort, if they want to build self-steem.

In conclusion, I believe that people should not praise the students work only to help them build their self-steem. Sometimes they have not put their best effort in their work. They are going to feel that they are always doing exactly what they needed to do, even if is not like that. In order to be self- confident students must do achievements. However, some people will not agree with my opinion and they will say that it is best to tell students that their work is well done, even when is not only not to make them feel bad or to damage their self-steem.",3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.659901,3.5824227,3.7113442,3.6478326,3.51402,3.6249797,2.7264545,2.7140155,2.889928,2.3515587,2.4866421,2.9337506,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,619,30,0.2310177705977383,20.633333333333333,7,4,"{'lowers', 'praising', 'glorifying', 'glorify'}"

Also some parents like to ask their children what he or she want to be in the future for example: doctor, teacher, dentist, police or engineer. At school teachers' tell students' to do a draw about what they are dreaming to be in their future and every students' at young age are have in mind what they will be in the future. It is a good idea fo students to commit to career at young age.

Students need time to prepare for they career in way to succeed in what they want to be in their future.

For example, all career take time to learn about each subjec and students might don't have enough credits to past some classes and they have to take the class again. In addition some students wants to be doctors' and the career for doctors' take a long time and a lot of money that they need to have in way to be get that career. Such of people have to save money in way to pay for they education for their career, but in some cases the government pays them education for to be a qualify student their school. Career takes time and knowledge in way to do exelents in what you are planing to be when get older.

Students will have the opportunity to learn more than one career and they will have the choose to decide what career they like most. For xample, students have have the option to change they career to other career that they find out that they like most. Furthermore students are young age can have many ways of opportunity to make a good future for their life. Also student can decide which career give them a good job for to have a better salary. Staring to study career at young age you have the option to learn about more career and get that one that you feel that you are good at.

Some people believe that students at young age don't have a good knowledge about what they want to be in the future. For example, they argue that students has to be more older to understand how to choose a career and how to be sure what career they want to be in ther live. Such of people says that student just like to be what his or her mother, father, uncle, cousing or some persone that they might almire career is, they might even now enything of thoses career that they want to be becuse they don't have much of knowledge about the job. Even though they says that students don't have in mind how really career that them want is not that easy that how they think it's; they says that students are not responsible enough to decide for ther future career at young age. People think students are not old enough to be ready to take a position in their live.

In conclusion students decide what career they want for their life. But also straring a career at young age students will have more opportunities to learn thinks that might help them in their future job. Deciding for what you want at a long time help students to do things better beacuse you have more time to fix you mistakes in your career. A good person with a good job and with a great future in font is the one who stared working for what they want at young age. High school will encurage students career at aerly age.

I really want to see the fancy cars that Italy make's like the Lamborghini or the Ferrari an the Alpha Romero or other car that i normally dont see here were i live. I also want to know more about their culture. i wan to learn their language i want to eat their food i want to know how they live if ts ruff or easy or even both. I really want to eat the real Italian food! i always wanted to see if their would be a difference. One other main reason i want to come is for the tours, i want to get on the cannou then paddle and ride the whole channel.

The reason why i really wan to see the fancy cars is because i have a big thing for cars. Ever since i was a little kid my dad will always talk about cars and i'll always be with him ill play with toy cars and and when ever i see i nice car i always call it out saying ""thats my mustang gt"" or ""thats my supra"". My cousin always modifies if cars (he's also a car guy) he's another reason why i like cars. He has a Rx-7 every single part is modified he spend more money on his car then he does of him self. When i grow up i'm going to be a car guy like him. Another reason why i want to go to Italy to see the cars is because were i live you would see a Ferrari like once every 1-2 years and over in Italy seeing a Lamborghini must be like seeing a mustang. so that is why i want to see the luxury cars.

I really want to know how their culture is. i want to know how life is over their i want to see if their kind or mean. i want to learn their language so i can talk with them. To me learning their language or understand it will be an easy thing to do. I think it will be easy because Italian and Spanish language is closely the same. I just don't want to be in on part of the country i also want to go to other places because i know that their are different cultures around the country.

I mainly want to try the real Italian food i dont want to be eating the American version of Italian food. I want to see if their a difference of the the foods i want to know witch one tastes better or if they taste the same. thats what i want to know about their culture.

Another thing that i want to do over their is go in tours. i want to go on tours because when i see on the TV shows, movies, and commercials i always say ""im tryna go their!"". I also want to go to tours over their because i can see the cultures and how places look their. When i go on tour i find out stuff that i didn't know about and finding about new thing is good for your brain. I also always wanted to go to the cannel waters and ride. ever since i was a little kid i would see that people would ride on the cannel waters.

This is why i want to go to Generic_City, Italy. because of all off these fun stuff i can do their. All of these are reasons why i want to go to Generic_City, Italy.

036042533396,"Do you ever feel like giving up just because you failed and you feel like nothing is going your way ?

In this paper i will argue that '' success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasms''

Sometimes it's okay to feel upset,mad and frustrated when you think you're trying your best and it seem like. Nothing it's working out for you .

Failure is the way to success and some people seem not okay with it. Most people also don't understand why it has to be like this. However we don't always get what we want in life and that's a fact. Because that's just the way it is you can't blame yourself for it either. Most of us think that you have to be successful the first time you try something. But sadly that's not how works for some of us but some are just lucky.

I remember a few years back when my Aunt Generic_Name open her second beauty salon. She was quite upset because nothing was going the way she wanted to and how she planned. It wasn't going well she felt like everything was falling apart. She started to lose a lot of costumers the first year she open the salon. But 2 years later she started to promote her beauty salon again. She kept trying till she achieved her goals and now everything going well for her. I think one the things that helped her a lot was her positive attitude towards everything. She also didn't lose her enthusiasm. I think this is a good example of ''success consist of failure''

Some of us might not agree that ''Success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.''

I know a few people that don't have this mentality. Just because you weren't successful doesn't mean you're not going to be ''somebody''. Or that you need to stop trying because it's not meant for you. But they are wrong because at the end of the day what matters is what you think you're capable of doing and what you can do.

Don't let others people get to you and keep hoping for the better. Another good example is most of the big celebrities that we know now days like Oprah,Ellen DeGeneres and many more were turn down before had disappointments and maybe gave up for a moment . But they never lost their '''enthusiasms'' and they made their dreams come true and pretty much that's how you become successful in life.

From time to time you need to start taking those ''Failures'' as a lesson and just keep trying to do better. Because that's how life is. Because you attempt to do something and it didn't go your way doesn't mean you have to put it aside. We are humans we make mistakes. But you just can't give up easily and losing hope. It's not an option either you just have to keep pushing and like people say ''Fake it till you make it .''

In the future i hope people start realizing that opportunities come and go. There's nothing wrong with failure. I'm pretty sure we all been there before and it's okay to feel like crap. But it's not okay to stop trying just because one door closes many more can open for you. You can go as far as you want to because you're the only one that can stop you from being successful.

Well, she was worried that everyone had their specific career picked out before going to high school and she was the only one that didn't. Students are not expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school because students will feel pressured at a young age and students will change their career options as they take different courses.

First, students are not expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school because they will feel pressured at a young age. For example, my friend Generic_Name wanted to become an astronomer but her parents wanted her to be an engineer, she felt pressured and didn't know what courses to take. During class time Generic_Name's teacher gave everyone in the class a paper to write the possible classes they wanted to take their first year of high school, but unfortunately Generic_Name didn't know what classes to take. While Generic_Name was still thinking her teacher approached to her and told her that both science and math courses connected to the careers she was debating to become, she also told her that after taking those classes she was gonna be able to pick the class she favored the most and go for that one. Some people believe that committing to a career at a young age will help students develop and make them smarter but they are incorrect because committing at a young age will cause students to have a lot of stress and give them less opportunities to join other classes.

Second, students are not expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school because students will change their career options as they take different courses. For example, Generic_Name was looking forward to become a professional soccer player but he knew he had a 20% chance of becoming one. One day during class time Generic_Name started to think about a serious career that he can actually accomplish and put extra time and work. He decided to become a history teacher; He enjoyed learning history so much that he thought about becoming the one to teach others history as well. Generic_Name was so pleased with his choice that he payed close attention on everything Generic_Name said and never hesitated to raise his hand and ask for more questions. Generic_Name took all the history classes he needed to take, he also joined debate class and a public speaking class therefore he would become better at public speaking and not be afraid to talk in front of others. A month later Generic_Name thought about how good he'll be if he became an attorney. Generic_Name definitely knew how to speak in front of others after taking the public speaking class and he also knew how to defend a case so he changed his career option and decided to stick with attorney.

Another example is that Generic_Name wanted to be a dog sitter but she was also interesting in the study of the human body and how it worked, so she decided to join a a psychology class and learn more about it.

In conclusion, students are not expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school because they will get a chance to pick the career they want as they take different courses in high school and it will also cause many students to feel pressured at such a young age. Students should know that they have all the time they need to learn and be curious about any class they put their interest into, as they grow up their brain will develop therefore they will become more smarter and they will have the chance to pick the career to want to be in.

There is a debate between people who thinks should people more accomplish then inactive. Some people believes their journal will take them to their destiny and they doesn't have to accomplish any thing. It doesn't matter for some people to make decisions and others think different. Because they think their destiny will take them to where they should be. In other hands, I believe what Thomas Jefferson said, ""Determine never to be idle...It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" This quote shows me why we have to make our decision so fast and not let to wait. Because we don't know what will happen in the future. We have to being more active, so it will help the country economy. When we are active the country rules and powers can change. Being active is optimal for immigrants too because it help them to learn new language. People always have to take life seriously because how they will know there will be a tomorrow. We should try to make decision before our destiny makes one for us.

First,

when people are more active by working hard it help the economy of a country. Many people accomplish succeed by working hard in difficult environment and it is beneficial for a country to have some excellent active workers. By accomplishing more succeed in your job they can rise your salary. In other jobs they always honor those who are working so hard. It's less chance to be loser. To find sussed everything basically inside your hand. When people accomplish more is not just for their beneficial it is for their country too.

Second, In the past women didn't have any rights in to the government until ninetieth amendments. Before women were inactive and that leave them behind, but after while they start having job in the government branch by protecting their rights. When women start being active it help them to accomplish more success. In America women are having more rights than any other country because they were fight for their freedom. In my own country which is Generic_City, women are afraid of men because women are not active and they never try to having voice in public. Still today men are making decisions for the women and treat them like a slave person, Some female from my country try to being active to make a differences in my country.

Third, some of immigrants try to be an active in their life by moving into another country. For immigrants it doesn't matter to accomplish more or not they just want a basic life. When my mom made the decision to move to the United State I was afraid to learn English and my mom use to tell me you can do it if you really wants to learn. When I first start school in U.S I was so nervous about how can I introduce my self to the teacher because I wasn't able to say hello even in English, but I trust my mom and everything changed. Finally, I get the success and that makes me really happy.

In conclusion, we all will find the success by working hard and not let anything make feel us failure. By accomplish more you will be succeed just don't lose your self. Be hard work and an active person is better than acting like loser. When people inactive they always behind of others and their life is meaning less. People should always accomplish more because there should be a line between who wants win and who wants lose.

20E2B07931F3,"Once in a while we all have been heard a phrase; ""TRY, TRY, UNTIL YOU SUCCED"". We all have been gone through failing, at some part of our lives. But we never give up and we do our best. And at the end we get more of it. Yes we accomplish more if we are always doing something. There are few people who don't agree to this statement. They say doing something more will not let you do other work. But rather than seating ideal, we should always try new things around. Trying new things can give new experience. Also, you can get better at things. And, moreover it also makes you strong. Rather than seating ideal, doing nothing; we should always keep on trying new things.

We humans always have dreams of doing things like: Sports, Cooking, Adventure activities, getting into music, dance, and many more. Doing something and trying out new things will always give you new experience. I wanted to learn guitar from my childhood but, it was not possible when i was in school. During my last summer break i joined guitar classes. It was next level experience to me. I learned so many new things which i never knew about guitar. There, i also met new people and made new friends. Meeting new people and knowing interesting facts about their lives is also a new experience.

On the other hand their are some people who says trying new things don't give you experience, and it also wastes your time. But if we want to at least full fill our dreams then we have to keep on working hard.

There are few people who argue; doing same things everyday won't give you anything and you will also not able to focus on other things. But that's not true. Doing same thing again and again can make you better and you can be best in the future. let's just talk about me when i joined my guitar classes. On the very first day i didn't knew nothing about guitar. Their were lots of things like: cords, tunes, vocal. This all were like a big giant algebra equation which were kept in front of me, in which i didn't even knew how to solve for x. I knew a little bit of knowledge how to play with guitar string, but i never knew much things in details. On the very first day when i went to my guitar class i was not really good. But after continuing playing for a month i actually started improving at that. And today i'm really good at playing guitar.

There are many individual who says that trying new things is a fail. And later it demotivates you and make you feel depressed and upset. Many of us our not really good at things. We fail at many things at first. In this situation many of us give up and don't try to take a second chance. But do we actually know that failure is the biggest key to success and it also teaches you many lesson. I'm not really great student who can Handel math. I failed in algebra1 in my 9th. Every test, every quiz, i used to get D or either F. But failing at same things again and again until i started getting good grades thought me so many new things. And it also made me more stronger. Failing makes you more stronger so that in future also you can fight with it.

In conclusion seating ideal will never make you succeed. Trying new things is a opportunity to learn new things and explore things around you.

99A3641592CA,"Do you think immagination is more important than knowledge? Why do you think it's important? Let's see why I think it's important! Well think about this you have the knowledge, but you never immagine things that you think you can't do. If you just immagine or think bigger about what you want or what you want to do. One day you will achive your goal or dream.

One of the reason why I think immagination is importantant is that if you don't immagine what you want to do in future as your job or hobby. When your in school your not going to try your best and show effort. If you don't learn anything at school when you are older to get a job, your not going to get the job you want, because wherever you are there will be someone that want the same job as you but trying harder than you, learning harder than you, and showing more effort than you. Which means effort creates achivements. For example, you went to an interview for a job at a store to be a cashier and there are 15 people that want to be cashier. But they only need one. So first they asked everyone what do you do when the costumer comes in. One of them said you have to smile and say hey, do you need help with anything? and you said you continue doing whatever your doing. Who do you think there going to pick? Of course the first one right? because she showed them effort and willing to do the job. That why you have to immagine what you want to do in future and try your best in school.

Second reason is that you have your knowledge, but if you don't immagine or think bigger your not going achive big things in your life. The people who failure in life are the people who quit something one step away from success. That's what a lot of people do. But the people who successed in life are the people who took the step that a lot people quit which the hardest step to take. For example, you want to start a company, but the people around you said that your not going to success. Although they said that you started a company anyways. After a month no one wanted to invest you company. You kept asking people to invest your company. So one person did, with that money you payed the bill. Then nothing happened to your company. But if you stop asking people when no one wanted to invest your company your company would of been closed. So you have to immagine thing and use your knowledge to achive them.

Third reason is you have to immagine things as your dream and get a lot of knowledge by learning at school. When I was little I wanted to become a docter when I grow up. Then I started immagining to help and more stuff. When I go to school. I told myself you have to be good at science, math and other subject to become a docter. So I will have knowledge about things that you have to know to become docter. so you have to get a lot of knowledge to achive the things you immagine.

So I think immagination is more important than knowledge. But knowledge is still really important. I feel like everything starts with immagination first. Then you go to school to get your knowledge increase every year. You work really hard to make immagination becomes reality.

DE921CECE21A,"Do we accomplish more by constantly doing something? Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" He believed that more would be accomplished if there was something being done most of the time, I agree with this. Accomplishing a task motivates some people to do more, accomplishing more, It also helps us learn more about ourselves. Although, people believe that being in-active is better because it provides less stress and more free time, It also keeps us from succeeding our daily tasks and influences us to be lazy.

Being busy would require us to be awake and alert of what we are doing. In some cases, after finishing up a task, all people want to do is move on and rest. In other cases, people choose to knock out more work that they have in mind. Having this kind of mindset it good, because it allows a person to have more energy and to keep themselves busy. A personal experience would be when I was so tired one afternoon, but I had to keep myself from napping because I had homework due. After I completed that one homework, I was too awake to even sleep; So I decided to knock out other work I had in the meantime. In the end I received a better grade from that class and I had chores finished from that week so I didn't have to do anything in the weekend. To conclude this paragraph, when I accomplished one thing I ended up accomplishing more than I expected.

We all have our different ways of living and learning. One way to help you learn more about yourself is by keeping busy. You learn how to manage your own time, you learn about how you react to a hectic environment which can help for future references, and You learn how your own mind works. For example, When I was in my sister's sixteenth birthday party, I also had school to focus on, homework to get done, and Sol's to focus on. For me it was a pretty hectic schedule, but I learned how to respond and manage my time. Learning how to manage my time came in handy when my sixteenth birthday came along. Everyone has a different way of living and learning, and keeping myself busy taught me a lot about how I live and learn.

Although being in active provides us with less stress and more free time, which is not always a bad thing, It influences us to not only be more lazy, but to procrastinate. To procrastinate put off something that should be done, To leave it for that moment and do it later, as you repeatedly tell yourself, but you occasionally never end up doing it. Procrastination can lead you to become more and more unprepared. Being unprepared isn't the best way to live. Having more free time can have it's positive outcomes, but also its negatives. For example, who wants to accomplish nothing now, only to do the same in the future? People may believe being in-active is a better way to live because it relieves you from stress and work, but doing nothing can follow with other bad habits that can lead to worse in your future.

In conclusion, we accomplish more by keeping busy. Keeping ourselves busy can help us prepare for our future, and help us learn more about ourselves and how to respond to a hectic lifestyle. Although some people would like to live a lifestyle doing absolutely nothing, that wouldn't be the case for all. Others would prefer to accomplish more by staying active and helping themselves prepare for whatever comes next.

477B00F899E2,"Student-designed Projects Encourage Learning

Summers can be boring for students, especially when homework is assigned. Students have creative minds and a variety of interests which can be specialized to a topic of interest; however, schools tend to assign a generic assignment to all students despite their differences. Summer projects are intended to enable students to continue learning and exploring the world through a lense of their interest. Therefore, allowing students to design their own summer projects allows for their interests to spark, their creativity to grow, and their areas of knowledge to expand.

Firstly, student-designed summer projects will allow for every student to specify the project on his or her interests. Every child is different and shows admiration towards different subjects in school. If teachers design the summer project, the students will lack incentive to explore an area of interest as that has already been done for them. Additionally, teachers will attempt to design the summer project in a way that it applies to all students; however, not all students think alike. For example, most middle schools conduct science fairs that allow kids to explore an area of science that particularly interests them. This allows for children to research heavily into a subject and even enjoy doing so. This not only sparks an interest for science, but it also allows students to show off their abilities and specialize in their talents. This science fair analogy can be applied to summer projects because children will develop their admiration towards an educational topic and will enjoy the learning process. This creates a positive incentive for learning despite it being summer.

Secondly, if students are enabled to design their own summer projects, creativity will occur and develop. When teachers design projects, students are incentified to simply follow instructions and do as they are told. This results in surface level researching and a lack of interest in actually learning and retaining knowledge. This is understandable as most students do not enjoy a generic assignment that does not apply specifically to their interests. However, if students were given the opportunity to design their own project, they could research a subject that sparks their interest and creativity. This will lead to a deeper understanding of the topic and will result in a better quality of summer projects completed over all. For example, refering back to the science fair analogy, most students will become creative and design their own experiments if they are given the opportunity to do so. Most students enjoy being given the freedom and trust to become creative and show off their interests.

Lastly, when students return to school after summer break, they will see a variety of interesting summer projects completed by their classmates. The student-designed projects allow for a large variety of topics to be explored, and will benefit the students intensely. If all students, for example, have the same assignment, they would be less interested in their classmates projects as they would all be generically similar. However, if the students have the opportunity to design and conduct their own research into their favorite topic, then the students can share each others interesting new insights with each other and spread their knowledge. This increases students admiration for learning and will inentify them to study something interesting for their classmates.

In conclusion, allowing students to design their own summer projects allows for their interests to be explored, their creativity to flourish, and their areas of knowledge to expand. Schools tend to fail to recognise that each student is different, and that he or she requires different learning styles in order to be successfull in learning. It is vital that students are given the opportunity to become creative and explore an interest that is dear to them. If this is not prioritized, schools will continue to foster the idea of simply following instructions.",4.5,4.5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.087908,4.122328,4.269272,4.1801286,4.1931376,4.146626,4.3498397,4.4244423,5.2193475,4.58018,4.1860814,4.326074,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,639,30,0.3755868544600939,21.3,7,9,"{'lastly', 'specialize', 'fairs', 'generically', 'researching', 'prioritized', 'homework', 'firstly', 'generic'}"
E12401B92C3B,"Some people want to be the best example in life; however, not all of them can be. Even the most famous and intelligent people that we can know is not the best example to follow because if we go and investigate their life they also have done things wrong. Everyone makes mistakes and is alright in this world. I disagree with what Albert Schweitzer said. In fact my personal conduct is not the best way to act for other people to follow me because it is difficult being a good example and is better if we influence them differently.

To begin it is difficult being a good example. Everybody does good things in their life; however, there are some days where we do not feel good and by accident or because we want to do it, so we do things not right. For example: I do not like when my aunts talk to their daughters about me. My aunts explain them that I am a good example in my family because I have two jobs and I go to school and in my free time I prefer to stay with them at home than going out with friends that they do not know. I know the things they say are correts but I told them do not use me as an explample because now I am like that, but if tomorrow I decide to quit school or I do other things is not going to be the best example they are waiting for. Some might say that it is easer having jobs and going to school and being a good example in your family because there are many people who does the same, but I know in reality is very difficult mostly if you are helping your family too.

Next is better if we influence them differently. Not by being their examples but being as a guide to follow. For example: I have an aunt who had her first kid at her 14 years old. Now she is 30 years old and she does not have more babies just the firt one. She tells to my cousins and I that it was the worse experience that she has not for her child but for her husband. She remembers everything that she lived at that age and how she had to deal when she can not have her baby because she was young and her body was not completely develop. Later for her surprise she had to work and maintain her child and her husband because he did not work or do anything. Now she cries when she tell us her stories, but my aunt says that she wants the best for us and she does not want it to happen to us. My aunt says that she is not the best example in our family because she did not obbey my grandparents, but she has learned many good things in life base in her experiences. Some people may say that they are the best examples for their children even if they do things not right in the past, but I believe that we learn from those mistakes but still we are not the best example because we already did bad things.

In conclusion being an example of our own behabior is not the best way to influence people! There are many different ways to influence others as you know it is difficult being a good example and is better to influence people diferently. There are many occacions where we recognize that we do great jobs in life, and people have to see us like good examples. However; people can see us like good examples but not to exaggerate because some people think that just because they do something good they are the best. And I know they can think that because every single minute in our life is count it and also challenged, and we do not want to waste our time.",4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.435924,3.2820516,3.537077,3.406914,3.201298,3.3156226,3.0307126,3.1527898,3.4468715,3.2675035,2.6730719,2.5287642,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,662,26,0.3444108761329305,25.46153846153846,10,4,"{'14', 'grandparents', 'alright', '30'}"
FE60E597467E,"What is positive attitude? Positive attitude is when a person has positive thoughts about something that went wrong or good, but they see all the possibles ways to success in life. Having a positive attitude is essential in lifestyle, this can bring happiness to your life, and can take you to extraordinary places. I think having a positive attitude is important because this is a way to express yourself around others, and to show the way you can manage your thoughts. I agree that having positive attitude is the key to success in life, and that everyone should have a positive attitude not just for a work area but anywhere.

There are many reasons to have a positive attitude, for example: you may want to have a positive attitude when you get a bad grade on the test, because you can think positive and say: "" I did bad on this test today but, I am going to keep trying and studying hard every time so I can do better"".

Another example is when you are doing a sport and you think you can't do it and that you are going to give up, you can tell yourself you can do it and have a positive attitude towards it. There are always problems in the daily life, and people deal with this problems not always with a good attitude.

What will happen if you don't have a positive attitude? Well if you don't have a positive attitude, you won't have success in life because you are going to have negativity in your mind and the word ""fail"" is going to become one of your favorites. Having a positive attitude is not always easy, and not all people have it. A negative attitude is the opposite of a positive attitude, and this can affect your life. For example: In school if you have a bad attitude things can go bad, when you are always being negative usually your problems don't get fix and you struggle more with your thoughts. This can mentally affect you, and teenagers are challenged every day by this issue.

The key is positively to a succesful life. I personally consider myself as a postive person. I try to solve every problem with a positive attitude because when I do so, my problems get fix the good way and I am happy with the results. If I don't have a postive attitude, all my goals would be nothing, I get stress and change my attitude, and I even hurt people's feelings without knowing. Success is important too because by this you can be a better person for society, people can judge you differently and you can help others when they are going through a lot. Positively is also mental strength,

it expands your knowledge, it changes the way you think about everything, and makes your life easier.

In conclusion, having positive attitude helps you to have success in life. Sometimes it's hard to understand how people can be so positive about everything, but not all people are happy in their lifes. Some people have their reasons to not be positive, and it's important to understand these people. Other people, like me, have postitive attitude towards anything, which is good because it helps you in your daily life, work, school and others activities. A lot of people like other people with a positive attitude, because it brings positive energy and hapiness to other people's life. Everyone should have a positive attitude, if you are not a positive person, it's not to late to change the way you are living , and it's time to have more positive thoughts and say "" positive"" for a successful life.

F90A6181BBCA,"In this world many of us make decisions by ourselves and others seek guidance to make decisions in their life. While some people argue that people should seek guidance to make decisions in their life, but I think it is more beneficial if people make their own decisions because if people make their own decisions they will develop their self confidence and they will become responsible person. Also, if people make their own decisions they will have happier life in the the future.

It's true that by making our own decisions that we will develop our self confidence and become responsible person. If person make decision that decision might be hard, after making the decision the person will develop his or hers self confidence and they will become responsible for the decision that they made. For example, if one person decides to leave his parents house to live by his own, he will be responsible for himself because he decided not to live with his parents no more. This will help him to be responsible person because he has to take care of himself by his own. Another example can be, In school, Students choose their classes for next year by themselves. This will help them to develop their self confidence because they are deciding what is better for them or not by their own. Also, this will help them to decide and have a confidence in what they will major in the future. So, by making our own decisions we can develop our self confidence and become responsible person.

Secondly, It's also true that by making our own decisions we will be happy and have happier life. When people make important decisions by themselves and if they achieve their goal by making this decision they will become happy and they can have happier life. For instance, if one student decided not to go college, instead he wanted to become a soccer player. If the student worked hard and become a professional soccer player he will be happy and will have happier life because he decided to become a professional soccer player by himself instead of going college. Additionally, In school, When I was sophomore, I was choosing classes for next year and I decided to take classes that I thought that are important for me and that can help me for college. Then when I take the classes this year I was very happy of my decision because this classes helped me a lot. So, people should make their own decision because they will be happy and have happier life by the decision they made.

On the other hand, some people argue that people should seek guidance to make decisions in their life because it helps them not to make wrong decisions, but I think that is wrong because if you always seek guidance to make decision in your life the decision that you made may not satisfy you in your future life. For example, if your parents advice you to make decision to become a doctor and if you made a decision to be a doctor by listening your parents ,in the future you might have bad life because being a doctor might not be part of your life. Also, you will experience difficulties in your life because your decision is influenced by others. So, people should make their own decision because it helps them to become better self confident person. By making our own decision we can gain a lot in our life.

Finally, people should make their own decision because it will help them to develop their self confidence and to become a better person by being responsible. Also, by making their own decision they will have a better life in the future. People should make their own decision to become better person by achieving their goals. Additionally, peoples have to make a decision by themselves because they can gain a lot in their life.

52F9582F9C86,"Every student should have the opportunity to be involved in extracurricular activities for them to enrich their educational experiences. Here are some reasons why they should be involved in activities, when they're involved in activities they have the opportunity to do different kind of stuff outside home, school, and even work. They also learn how to be independent and responsible. Also being in extracurricular activities could also help the students health.

First, when students are involved in activities outside school and home, it gives them the chance to experience different things outside school, home, or even work. They learn different kind of things. Things they wouldn't learn in school. For example during school they learn about math, science, history, and english. When they're home they do nothing but homework and help around the house some students have to work. If they're involved in activities, they have the opportunity to experience different kind of stuff for example: if a student decided to do a sport they would learn about that certain sport and they would also play it and enjoy it with a team. If they play a sport they would have to also practice at home, but not verse others or be in a team to practice with.

Second, students learn how to be more independent when involved in activities. For example, when I decided to join figure skating I wasn't independent, I didn't really know how to do things by myself, and when I joined at first it was kind of hard because I needed help with everything but as time passed by I started to learn how to be more dependent. I started doing almost everything by myself without any help, I was more dependent at home, school, and figured skating. Being involved in this activity, also taught me how to be more responsible. When doing activities you need to learn how to use your time wisely because you will need time for school, homework, family, and the activity you're involved in. Being involved in an activity is a good way to learn how to be responsible, how to be independent, and how to manage your time wisely.

Last, joining an activity can help with your mental and physical health specially if its a sport. Joining an activity is a good way to distract yourself from school, home, or work. This is because you will be thinking about the rules of the activity or about the point of that certain activity. It also helps your physical help meaning that it helps you exercise and it helps your body do what it needs to do. Being involved in a sport is a good way to help you exercise and distract yourself from other things. Being involved in activities such as sports or school clubs allows you to enjoy that time. If its something you really like then its something you can look forward to after having a bad day or a stressful day. When I had a bad day I would always think about skating and what I should do to make my jumps better. I would also go to the skating ring and practice, this helped me be more active and helped my physical health too. Being involved in a sport or any other activities is a good way to help students look forward for things.

Some people may argue that schools should control student involvement in extracurricular activities because some students don't have time to do school assignments but that shouldn't be their problem, that would be the students problem because students should know that if they join more than one activity they will still need to do school assignments such as homework or projects. Students should learn how to manage their time and use it wisely. Students and families should control the student involvement in extracurricular activities.",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.946404,3.9105785,4.0568695,3.9674826,3.9556358,3.9944072,3.942285,3.4175162,3.8139904,3.3663726,2.9294238,3.313228,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,650,30,0.3046153846153846,21.666666666666668,2,6,"{'distract', 'jumps', 'extracurricular', 'stressful', 'homework', 'skating'}"
CD81F6CCE819,"I believe that self-esteem comes from achievement because the more a student work hard, the more achievements he/she get so when they receive more awards and/or achievements, it makes them to proud of their selves and build true self-esteem.

There are so much students who works hard, complete their work on time and also have a part time job after school, but they don't know how to build their true self-esteem so what they need to work is that they must be self confident because they can't build their self-esteem unless they're self confident.

Also, there are much more students who go to school and don't have a job or anything after school or during weekend and they're self confident, but don't know how to build their self-esteem.

So, students should try their best to receive achievements because it encourages and/or makes them to build their self-esteem.

Self-esteem is something that students can build it by theirsleves if they work hard, be punctual at school and have a checklist or a plan for what they should do first as a calender.

Students aren't working hard nowadays I have no idea that it's because technology makes them lazy or they don't want to plus they're not trying to achieve something at school.

I'm sick and tired of seeing these kind of students because if they just open their school backpack and at least study for two hours at home, they will receive a lot of achievements at school so that's how they can achieve their goals.

So, when it comes to build their true self-esteem, they need to work on achievements and become self confident first and then best version of their selves.

Teachers also have a role in this issue because I think students spend more time with their teacher compare to their parents in a week.

I don't mean teachers discuss with them to build either their self-esteem or self confidence unless the student is smart and curious to ask his/her teachers and peers about becoming like a person who has self confidence and already built his/her self-esteem.

But, at least they show students the right way to get achievements or achieve their goals so that would be enough, and students will start thinking about how to get achievements and then they'll probably start working on their self confidence and self-esteem.

In addition, when I came to the united states it was 2017, I didn't know any English and I didn't have any friends at school so everybody knows how hard it is to go to school and can not speak with anyone or don't have friends plus I was a shy guy.

When somebody was trying to talk to me, my face was becoming red and start blushing so it's all because I didn't have self confidence.

So, I am still trying my very best to learn the language and make some friends at school so I can play or do my work with them together.

That being said, now I can speak, write and read very well and I became so much more confidence, best version of myself, have a lot of friends, and so happy to attend school.

Overall, being self confident and working hard for achievements are like a key for building students self-esteem which comes from achievements.

Students should focus at school or wherever else they study so they get achievements which helps them to build their self-esteem.

Students also should be encouraged by their parents to build their self-esteem as well as by their selves unless they're self confident in life.

C70AEFA3CD16,"I am agree with the Emerson's statement, be yourself in a place where everyone else want you to be something else is a greatest accomplishment, because be who you are is really hard, more when people is trying to make you do things that you do not like or want, and ignore that kind of persons is a hard achievement. The differences in the people is what make us specials, because every vary has their own thing that they are good a it and they like to do it. And be in a place where is hard to be yourself is not easily to support it, and it is complicate it. Be who you are in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. Because stay in a place where no one let you be yourself is really difficult, desperate, and sadly.

Is difficult be yourself in a place where no body accept you by how you are, the immigrant know how that feels, because they came from a different country where they have different culture and believes. Mexicans immigrant is hard to be their self in USA, because the culture and language is different than the Mexican people specially the language, learn a new languages is hard and when Mexicans do not learn the language yet they feel like they are not accepted, because no one can understand them. The difficulty of be in an immigrant is that you have to learn the culture, and language of the country but you do not have to stop being yourself. Because I know that be in a different country is hard to be yourself.

it is desperate when people try to make you something else, most of teen anger got desperate when their parent try to make them something that they dont like. Teen angers just want to be their self and do things that they like. Because when parents, family or other people try to make you something different of what you were thinking is really stressful. Sometimes people try to make you something else, because they think that is going to be good for you but they dont think if is going to like or if you are good at it they just want you to do what they think is better for you but parents forget your opinion. Is desperate too when you doing something different than others and they tell you that you are wrong.

Being in a place where no body want you for being different of what they want is sadly, because people do not accept you for how or who you are, and persons that are different are mostly alone. A student that is immigrant could understand this because when a student that is immigrant go to a new school from other country have to learn a new language, and some other students that are from that country dont accept the immigrants just for be them self. And I think that is but people should accept other persons that are from other countries and let them be their self. In that way people can learn many new think that can be interesting, and everyone is going to be happy, but when people do not accept other people and dont let them be is sad, cause they are alone.

I am agree be yourself in world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the grates accomplishment, because being alone in a place where no one accept you for who you are is very difficult to live, is desperate hear things that you dont wanna do and people still try to tell you what to do to make you something else, and sadly when no one want you just for be different and you have to be alone. In conclusion be yourself and do not give up is the biggest achievement. Always is going to be hard to be who you are but never give up.

C1959178FC53,"According to Thomas Jefferson: ""Determine never to be idle...it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" What he wanna said is that if we are always working and never have free time we will accomplish so much more. We could see that why he is saying this because he is a hard working man and look at what he have done to the world, there is nothing wrong for working hard. But if we are always working and don't spent time for ourselves or time with family then you could accomplish more but you will suffer a lot more for that successful.

For example, when we work hard and don't spent time for our self or we don't have any private time to relax and stop thinking about work, we will get stress and stress led to a lot of thing like can't sleep at night,depressed,or maybe can't eat well. So we definitely have to manage time well between work and time for yourself to maintain doing good work and have a good and healthy life. Like another scientist that work hard like Thomas Edison, his name is Albert Einstein, he work really hard but don't manage time well so he have barely sleep a day. Some even said he only sleep 3 hours a day, and the consequence is he died at the age of 60 because of sickness and he even have autism when he stay awake for too long and talking to his own self. That is why we have to have free time because we don't want to get stress and get tired of our work so it can led to quit job or we getting fired.

Another important thing is that we need to spent time well with our family too because family is where we have the most support from and also the reason why we work for so hard if we don't have time for our family then they will leave us and then, by that time we gonna work and live so hard because we are lonely. And we might suicide or getting depressed and lead us to drugs. Family is what matter in our life and that is why we have to spent good time for them so they can be with us and support us when we need to so we can work harder for. I have an uncle in Generic_City, he is a successful business man, he work for a well-known medical company and and owner of a market but to pay for what he own is his time for his family. He start work at 5 a. m and go home at 11p. m and he never have time for his family. That is why during this summer his wife leave him, his daughter don't wanna see him anymore because he was never there for her, and his son just never call or visit him. Now he is 40 and he is a very success person but after all of that he is still and lonely old man. This is why we need to spent time for our family because after we work so hard in our lives but we dont have family after that we are just lonely peoples that have no one to make our life happy til the rest of it.

i think Thomas Edison quote have nothing wrong with it, and it is true that human can do so more if they are not have idle time. But if we don't have those idle time we will soon face with stress, disease, depressed, loneliness and also suicide, so why we work so hard and don't have free time so we die in miserable ways when we can work hard and play hard too and enjoy our life in a really good way.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.1764293,2.981113,3.2689564,3.1090305,2.8340046,3.0719595,3.534129,2.5562205,2.70613,2.5003767,2.720832,3.3445847,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,660,20,0.3484848484848485,33.0,13,7,"{'40', '5', '3', '60', 'til', 'wan', 'autism'}"

Your principal has decided that all students must participate in a least one extracurricular activity. For example, students could participate in sports,work on the yearbook, or serve on the student council.

Would Students want to be forced into taking a program, club, or after school activity, no, of course not. Nobody wants to be forced into doing anything in life. Besides if a student was forced to participate in an program what activity's would they have. what if he/she doesn't like sports or working on the year book or etc. How does it benefit the student in any way.

Students should have a right to decide whether or not they want to join a club or activity. The reasoning for this is because, if a student does not like any of the programs then it wouldn't be fair if he/she still had to choose one. Thats why its wrong for the principal to make this decision. Imagine a boy who just moved in from a different state. The boy had a lot of amazing, awesome friends that he had to leave behind. Now he has to transferred to the nearest school, having to start anew. His parents gave him the election forms and he has signed up for everything he needs. Only later to realize that it is a requirement to sign up for a ""extracurricular activity."" Although the boy does not want to sign up for an activity because he does not know anyone. Now put yourself in that students shoes how would you feel in his situation.

Most Students just want to get through the day, get home and relax. However, by adding this system the principal is adding a whole other level of stress for these students. I mean who would want to be forced into working on the yearbook or playing soccer yea absolutely no one. Students want to be free. Except with a required activity they have a whole other class to worry about and making sure that class has good grades especially if that student dislikes being there.

It needs to be a choice whether or not a student wants to select a ""extracurricular activity"".

I can see a probable reason the principal made this choice. I assume it is because the principal does not want there to be empty clubs/programs and that makes sense but it isn't fair to the students who do not want to be apart of any activities. Now it would make sense if the principal had a democrative system where the school voted for this option but thats not the case in however that is what the principal should do and the principal should ask the school to vote to get rid of the requirement or keep this way this can give the students, the principal and staff more reassurance. If the principal did do this then a huge weight is lifted off their shoulders.

Jumping to my next conclusion if a extra activity is required then this can cause stress and anxiety for students who dont want to be there. This can cause of lack of thinking process, failure in grades and bad attitude.

Let me explain. myself for example. If I was in a extra elective and I was forced to be in and i didn't like it I would start to stress then my grades in that class would start to fail, then slowly my grades in other classes would also fail. Now my parents would start to be disappointed in me and i would start building up anxiety. That anxiety if built up enough would most likely lead to depression and worse case scenario suicidal thoughts.

So in conclusion it is a bad idea to require a extracurricular activity.

Instead of forcing it i would heavily recommend choosing a activity because you never know how someone feels about certain things.",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.666748,3.5869672,3.7749844,3.738592,3.6368713,3.4890234,3.0762696,3.4767048,3.581717,3.123935,3.4074254,3.1570039,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,652,36,0.4125766871165644,18.11111111111111,9,7,"{'yearbook', 'yea', 'extracurricular', 'soccer', 'elective', 'suicidal', 'scenario'}"
5D693DD9978D,"How will be high school different if you will graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years? Three years things happen very fast than four years. you can't learn a lot things that happen in high school in three year because you will follow different plan for to graduate early. It is not a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college because I have to force my work, I will be indecisive and I won't be able to take elective course. All this will be hared days for me to finish my high school in three years.

Firstly, if I want to graduate in three years I have to force my work because I must have to take courses during the summers or in the evenings. And I do not wanna do that because normally my family every summer go to visit different country. Also I have to take course course during the evenings where I go to play soccer because I like to play. For example, if I want to graduate early I could not do this and I am to young to force my life, I have time to take this things slow because when I force my work I feel like my work will be wrong and I could not learn anything and that can not help me to go to the college. So three years is to short to learn everything that we have to learn in high school. It is not a good idea to force your work because like you did to learn things from the high school is how you will forget it.

Also, finish your high school in three years do not let you to think about what you want to study for the college because your course will be to short and you won't to do a good decision. If you have a lot time you can think better and you can find a new goal. For example, when i was in eleven grade i did not what i want to study when i will go to the college. But now i am taking geometry and i like it. Now like to be architect because i found that math is one of my favorite class. If i just took three years of high school i did not what want to do for college. So three years is to short to take decision for go to the college, you can go but as a indecisive student.

Finally, high school in three years will be boring for me without course elective because there two courses electives that i like. One of them is art and band those became me a good students, they change my life. For example, when i play the violin in my class with my classmate that moment, i forget everything that was wrong in my life. Another example is art where i can draw my happiness and i can remember that the life is not wrong. So i prefer to study four year and take my course elective than to study three years whiteout enjoy my high school with my course elective. it is a not a good idea to students to study three years of high school because they won't find the taste of high school.

Some people think that work force, indecisive person and won't be able to take course elective is better because they want to graduate early. They do not care about their life, they just want to do this to do that and they do not learn anything. However, to go the college you need to be more prepare because college is different than high school. That is why must of the college is hard to enter because some educational programs offer that allow high school student to graduate in three years and then when they go to college they do not anything. Because in three years is not enough for a high school students.",3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,3.1444216,2.946851,3.2311926,3.0227673,2.7868347,3.0519397,3.7198975,3.101162,3.2576032,3.38081,2.8808491,3.45441,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,676,29,0.2781065088757396,23.310344827586206,3,10,"{'hared', 'electives', 'classmate', 'soccer', 'elective', 'wo', 'whiteout', 'wan', 'indecisive', 'firstly'}"
2DDFC0DFC442,"Highschool is a big step in the growth of students. The step from middle school to highschool is a very diffecult one. As kids start to grow older there minds also change and sometimes the dreams they had of becoming someone or something is different in highschool.

Many young students in highschool don't really know what they want to be when they get older. And sometimes highschool forces kids to try to find the job or jobs they want to do when they get older. I feel like as a highschool student my self, and as an 11th grader I still don't know what I want to be when I am older. I feel like for young adults like me school isnt the only thing they have in mind. For example, I have a lot of out of school activitys that take away from always just focusing on school. Also for highshcool kids relationships can be a hard. They take up all your time and they also make you angry and stressed. And that can also take away from learning and your future as I know very well myself.

As young adults, Students that don't really have the ropes done in our day to day life in highschool I dont think commiting to a career in highschool is a good idea. I think schools should be teaching kids about different jobs and fields they might want to get into. But I dont think forcing kids to make there choises in highschool is something teachers should be focusing on. Instead they should be focusing on how different students learn in others ways. There are always kids that can learn and achive everything by just sitting in a class room and listening to a teacher talk. And there are the kids that can't just learn in a class room. The kids that have hard time at school becasue they have disabilities.

Teaching students in highschool to be succesful is what highschool need to do. I feel like schools mainly focus on getting kids to collage and what not. But some students dont want to go to collage or even get a job durring or even after school. I feel like school should help students become successful in school but not drive them towards anything. Meaning students should feel free to do what ever they want after highschool. And it all starts with teachers asking kids what they want to do when they grow up. And a lot of students dont even know what they are going to do in the next 2 months to come.

Sometimes collage is not what everyone wants. For me I want to take a gap year right out of highschool. And go play soccer somewhere. In my highschool days so far, Highschool was always been hard and its a big step from middle school. The teachers are not really on you as much as they were in middle school. So it makes u feel like u have more time for yourself. And its good in some ways becasue it teachers u how to be indepentent. But also as teachers give u more lead way students become more likely to do worse. They think its just easy to skip classes and not get in trouble. So for me everything that i have explained makes choosing a career during highschool really hard.

All in all students should feel like they have the fredom to do what they want when they are at the later years of highschool with out the burden of everyone around him or her telling them they have to go to collage or that they have to choose a career when they are in highschool.

I think Making studetns choose a career when they are in highschool is not something schools should be focused on. They should be focusing on having kids grow and not having them choose there careers at a young age.

F52394B3500C,"I think that school should not follow the business model. Adding two more hours to the schedule is not worth it for example some student need that time to other activities like go to the gym or play any sport and by adding two more hours that means that they are not going to be able to do all kinds of activities after they get out of school. There are some student whom work after they get out from school, they need that time to go work and make their money and having to stay on school two more hours means that are not going to have the same time as before to work also means that they are going to make less money. Staying on school two more hours will be a difficult task like myself I need go home after I am done with school because I have to take care of my house like make my sister food and clean my house I have to do that every day after I get out from 0school that is why it will be difficult task to do for me to stay two more hours on school.

I think that adding two more hours to the schedule and only having to go to school for four days only is not good idea sure we want to save energy as well but school can not afford to follow the businesses model. For example student can not afford to stay on school for 10 straight hours they are going be really tired and by being like that they might do their work wrong. Also those student whom work after school if they stay two more hours I think that they are going to be really tired for work I have some friends they start working at 5pm they get out of 3pm that means that they will have time to rest for two hours but if they have two stay on school for two more hours that means that they will get out of school at 5pm so they are not going to have time rest an just have to go straight to work. Another disadvantage of getting two more hours of school is that for those students whom works and get homework that means that they will not have time to do their homework for example myself I have to go home early to take care of my house I have to care of my house quickly so I can start doing my homework so staying two more hours on school for me it will be difficult to do all of that task after I get out from school.

Of course there are some benefits from adding two more hours to the school schedule like saving resources and saving energy also those student whom does not do anything after school can learn more because they can concentrate more they does no to worry about what they are going to do after school. There are some student whom does not do anything after they get out from school so for them it does not really matter whether they have o stay two more hours or they does not have to stay like my friend Generic_Name he is a student who does not do any actives or their go to work after school so for him it does not matter if have to stay two more hours. Having two more hours means that those student whom does not do anything after school can have more time con do their school work as well study more for their test. The benefit of adding two more hours only benefits those who does not do anything after school.

In conclusion trying to follow the businesses model is not good idea for our school, so many student are going to arguing for it they are going be saying that just by trying to save a little bit of energy and resources they have to change so many things and sacrifice their money and their time in fact is not a big different adding two more hours two the schedule every day because that means that we till have to use energy in those hours.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0566537,2.9042497,3.1626537,3.0223296,2.8154058,2.951437,2.7630937,2.7350805,2.7701335,3.0982394,1.9786018,2.5183756,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,707,13,0.2588401697312588,54.38461538461539,4,4,"{'homework', '10', 'disadvantage', 'gym'}"
01501F95B8B2,"10pm curfews is a bad idea, why? Because teens lives would be affected in many different ways, including the fact that in can get them in much more trouble. Teens would have to adjust to this rule and some might not even know about the rule when it comes out. I think that teens should not get an early curfew but instead change it to a later time, so teens dont have to go through having to deal with changing there hole life around. having a law like this can get teens in more trouble because now they have an extra law that can be broken easily with out even knowing. teens enjoy being out late and doing things, it can make them feel older and more grown up like.

Teens are stuck in school seven hours a day and it can take a good bit of there day away so having that option to stay out later and being able to do things is a great option for them. Lots of teens want to go shopping and hang out with friends at a mall, but school and homework can take a while so they cant do it during the day always. for example, a friend and me wanted to go to the movies after school but we got assigned lots of home work and we new we would be busy the next days, so in order to be able to watch the movie, we would have to go at night time. curfews can inter fear with couples who want to do something later in the night, and it would be unfair to the teens to have to go back home just because they can't stay out late. Having said all this, teens are old enough that they can make there own decisions.

Lots of tees have after school jobs taking them late into the night, and a lot of them need to be able to walk home. Teens would have to start having to start to work around the new law and make changes to there work hours. Also kids would start getting less work hours resulting in the not getting enough money, some house hold have teens helping pay bills. Curfews laws are and will be the most common law being broken resulting in an increase of crime. teens do not like it when they get told how long they get to stay out, which will result in them just braking the law.

I would be surprised if teens would start getting in less trouble, because teens will still do what they want even if you set a curfew. A curfew only tells a teen that your not suppose to be outside, but that still does not mean that they will do it. Teens are going to do what they want at the end of the day and not what the law tells them to. The best way to make sure teens can stay on track but the still to be a curfew is that the curfew should be moved up to 12pm. Also teens enjoy going to gas station at night to get stuff and lots of the enjoy the walk as well.

In conclusion I think that if we just move the curfew up to 12pm it would allow teens to have a good night out with out having to worry about being out to late. Also showing that kids can get in more trouble by having an early curfew just means that its a bad idea and should not be implemented. If adults could just put more trust in teens i think it would improve kids behavior and also have kids get to prove them self to show how responsible they can be. teens are more responsible than everyone might think, I think they just need a chance to prove it to everyone. I think earlier curfews are a bad idea and that it should just be moved up a little for that will help teens out in the long shot.",3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.6748805,3.6460123,3.7859817,3.7893167,3.6379,3.5428486,3.7080953,3.4282246,3.548457,3.8137372,3.5306394,3.0173645,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,677,26,0.361890694239291,26.03846153846154,5,9,"{'mall', 'braking', 'curfews', 'curfew', 'tees', 'cant', 'homework', 'inter', 'implemented'}"
78B89BF70AE8,"I am agree with Emerson's statement about individuality because in this world you have to be yourself and if doesn't mater how you are, you have to be yourself even if the world is against, because the world doesn't change you. You change the world, and you have to be sure what you want and what you do not want, you have to be yourself, you can be different, the different it is not bad, because sometimes ""Be like others is do not be no one"".

For those reasons is why you have to be yourself, you have to follow your dreams and you have to fight for them, don't let the people throw you, and if you felt, you have to get up and keep fighting for your dreams. Remenber if you felt 99 times, you have to get up 100 times, and never let that people and the world convert you in something that you don't want it, in something that you don't love it, in something that you don't wish or something that you don't enjoy.

Also in my life some people tried to change myself, but I always try the way to carry on and keep fighting for my drams, and one of my dreams was traveled to this country, and some people told me that I can not do it, even some people told me that I will die on the long way from El Salvador to United States.

That was a long and a hard way, a diifficult trajectory, but I did my objective. It was not easy, because sometimes I had to sleep in the desert or in some mountains, so the polices can not found me.

Also sometimes I had to move the one place to another placer and some pelaple and me did it acrros the cars, but we had to hide on the trunk of the cars, and I remenber we was like 12 persons on a trunk car. It was not easy but I did it.

I remenber some days that I had to walk for hours to be in some place close the border, and also some days that i didn't eat nothing because I didn't have food, and in some ocassions I feel that I can't no more, but on my mind I had a objective and a dream. My objective and my dream were stay in this country and to provide help to my family.

But in my mind I am keeping have some objectives and dreams, and one of my objectives is makes to my parents proud of me and one of another objective for me is be a example to my brothers, I wanna give it to them the best of the world.

My brothers and my parents are the reason why I work hard everyday, and I try to do the best on school, I try to be a really good students but sometimes it is hard for me, because the languages are different, so I try everyday to learn English, so everything can be easier and that can help me a lot.

You always have to be yourself because a more than a person goes to like you, so just be you and don't let the world change you. Keep dreaming and get foccus on your objectives.

Don't be afraid in a world that is constantly trying to ,ake you something else, just be you and don't worry be happy, enjoy the little big things that the world give it to you like friends and family, enjoy with people that you love, and always be thankful with everyhing, if doesn't matter if it is good or bad, everything happen for a reason.",3.0,2.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.952903,2.78795,3.1178865,2.9274964,2.70568,2.7868092,3.0561635,2.6484997,3.107428,2.8780434,2.692401,3.1596162,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,636,16,0.3191823899371069,39.75,13,10,"{'polices', 'drams', 'wan', '12', 'placer', 'mater', '100', 'trajectory', '99', 'salvador'}"
C5B351564A3F,"According to this prompt can you imagine that some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, to conserve energy and resource. However, now did you ask to your self, should your school follow this model by extending the school day two hours?. went i think in that i give me some thing. although, follow this model by extending the school day two hours have benefists and disadvantages of follow this model to a four day of school week .

fist, think about benifist that is very important part for students and for the employees , however consider how this model is going to help students and employees from school. Then how this model is going to help the school if they dont conserve energy and resourse. For instance, teachers are affected in how they give students work when they need some proyect to do how they use energy if they dont have resources. Now left think about if school dont have resourses how students use the restroom if dont have water, students also use water to get a shower went they have a game in the school, another think is that women in the kitchen they need water for cook and give students lounch. However, some students work after school and teachers needs to take care their childres after school or some teachers live very far. Beside, they could affect school education. Lastly, school are affected for many manner this affect whith the hours being to a four day school week in the other hand,

let meask abouth disadvantages.

Second, students,teachers and employes are affected in the disadvantages. For example, some students work after school if students wants to stay after school maybe they lost their jobs because they dont present to his work or if they have some homework to do after school they can no stay because they need to work studens are affected. Beside, teachers are affected too because after school they need to take care they childrens or maybe some teachers live very far and spend many time for arive to his home. In the other hand, school employes lost his work because if school work only four day at week the drive lost some hours of job this affect some employes and their families. Thats why this dissadvantages affect studens work and students education because some students dont came to the school if they are resposable with his job. However in my case this affect me because i work after school and i need came to the school too but i need some money. They are many reasons why this disadvantages affect students and employees. Let me ask some benefist that is good.

Finally should fallow this model by stending four day school week you should have some benefist. For example, you should have one day off to stay at home with family, do the homeworks that the teaches give you or spedn more time to study, teachers can relax one day or maybe they prepare students assignment.

In conclution, to conserve energy and resource to considering the benefits and disadvantages to a four day school week, many pleople are affected mostly students and teachers because two hours would affect students job, also the teachers because some teaches live so far from the school and they dont have time to past with his family. In the other hand, the good thing is that they should have one day off and they can relax, students can do their homewors and they can study for his test or maybe they can go to his job in the day off. But is important can to the school every day because we need to learn more every day and in the future can take a better job we can do a good people and a good example for our family.

No people should not make there own decisions because sometime people need more opinions with thing they do. Like if they want to watch a move they can ask others on what to watch and they can help you out. Some people will say it's your life do what you want, make your own decisions but it is not that easy. I feel like sometime it's better to get guidance from other people, like my parents or older siblings because they are older and have been through some of the thing I have gone through. Sometimes things get hard in life and you are going to need help, we all as people need someone in life to help guide us through thing that may be bad. If you don't know what you want to be in life then you can think about things you like or get help from someone that you know that had that career. There is always going to be someone to go to for help even though people will say it's better to work by your self because you will not make any mistakes but we all make mistakes.

CD4135EAFB1E,"A Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered,you will never grow. Some will said you'll grow but won't reach their beyond what they mastered. Some will disagree with Ralph Waldo Emerson statement, because doing something beyond that already master will never stop you from doing it. In the pass year I played a Villain before I reach goal becoming beyond with a instrument that I didn't know how to play, I master how to soccer for the first when I was little, and at the end of the day your going to be beyond great when you don't give up.

When I was 6th grade in middle school I never though I was going to learn how to play instrument for the first time in my life. The instrument that I'm now play is Villain my brother though I wasn't good enough to play a instrument. I practice every days to get better and to try my best. I played three year in middle school I was getting good and then I love how sound made with bows and string. The teacher once said if stop playing then your going to forget the string note and how to used correctly. When I got to middle I learned how to play a interment for the for time in my life become beyond. I didn't stop growing I kept growing to become better to play.

Why won't we reach our goal then become beyond because doing something beyond your reaching a goal to finish. This was a time where I want to learn how to play a sport. When I was little I wanted to play soccer but I didn't started learning until I was 10 years old. My goal was to learn how to play soccer, until one day I was at the park with my family and friend I learn how to play soccer. My uncle tough me how to played soccer for the first time.

He showed me how to kick the inside and outside of my feet. My uncle told me that I was fast learner that I kicked correctly with forced. So we played soccer just kicking back and forth until knew how to kick. When I was 7th grade I sign up for the girl soccer team for the school. When I made the team I was exacted because I never though I going play for school soccer team and it was the first to play. The couch liked how I played but my friend though I was beyond great but I didn't believe them. When I got to 8th grade I wanted to sign up again because some of my friend was joining, then when I made in the team next then I know they voted for me to become captain for the girl soccer team. The coach was beyond how I played for the game I made 8 goal in the season but I never stopped playing soccer. Until the moment in my life I knew that I had master my goal.

I'm 16 year old about to turn seventeen in July I have reach so many goals in my life and then it when beyond. I learn so many thing on my own because my parent didn't know English. At the end of day I had teacher and friends that help me all my school year. The one key that my parent tough me was never give up on yourself, if you don't understand the problem then go to the next problem then come back to finish the rest. So all this year I learn how to play a instrument that was a villain and playing a sport that love I become beyond great and master to become better. I grew up become better the thing I love the most and did it because I had sibling following my foot step since I was the oldest in my family.",2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0208383,2.8766997,3.1691508,2.979887,2.685924,2.917395,3.530938,3.3696115,3.6312177,3.4511201,3.4046884,3.6886923,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,680,31,0.3191176470588235,21.93548387096774,10,11,"{'villain', '16', 'bows', 'exacted', 'soccer', 'sibling', 'wo', 'learner', '10', '8', 'interment'}"
E738D8E24101,"Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something,or does inactivity also serve a purpose? Students should be active in all the school year even for the intire life. I belive that be active help us to increase our skills and the practice made an expert. In the other hand,others belive that be inactive can result good and help them to don't become tired and old to fast. The people do more accomplish if they are always doing somenthing,students who practice sports can become better they have more resistence,and Moreover,Stay active can help us to be more profecional even in a jod. Exercise help our body to stay healthy.

However not everyone is agree with this position. Some people belive that stay inactive is more accomplish because doing the same thing can become bored,Doing nothing doesn't help us to progress and be success for the intire life,The students who don't practice any sport or are not involve in any school program have more time to study and rest their maind that can result good in their final grade.

Forthemore,be active help us to increase our skils and the practice made an expert because if we are always active in what the teacher tell us to do at school,we can increase and be more and more faster the next time,that also can help to find a job because every boss want a good worker, and also that give us a good reffert because anyone can say good things about us depending on what we have done do far at schools,even outside the school like comunity service.

In addition,students who practice sports can become better because they can have more resistence and their body is healthy,also they can be hard worker in the future because their body is already made to bear that,practice sports at the schools is good because students recive credits for that and a reward if they win,that can give us new experiences and fun time also makes new friends who like to be active like me and others students around the country and around the world.

Moreover,sleep good and having the hours to rest help us to be active the next day don't feeling tired and sleepy because the students have to wake up early on the morning and gives all what they have at the school,everyone want to be a good student and pass the tests and everything,also be active depend in how much energy we have thats way we have to eat on the morning to have energy and be active the all day.

Finally,it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something because we can get our goals working hard,students making goals to the end of the school year, stay active help to makes goals and get what we want to the of the school year,stay active can include be participate en class,colarate in a school proyet,sport team,drama,school announcement and everything that involve school learning,after Hig School or in the collage,be active helps to go to the collage because we can get a Beca for our work in Hing School.

Overall,stay active is more accomplish and help us to the entire life and make us better now and in the future because if we do the things rigth,we can earn more money when we start to work,stay active not only benifit us also the people around us because they can see us that we never stay in one place thats mean we are not conformist a person or student who want to overcome their self.

95FD6DF25420,"Hi my name is Generic_Name and I am going to talk about energy and resources. The reason why we are talking about energy and resourses is because ,some busineses have adopted a four day work week. They want to because they want to conserve energy and resourses.

Each work week is going to be for 10 hours but in my opinon that is not going to work. I think it is not going to work because, people are barely working 8 hour shift and working 10 hour shifts. It is going to be more painful for people, and they are going to get really tired. In my opinion if they are going to make people work for 10 hours for 4 days, they have to increase the minumim wage and pay a little bit more money.

Their is alot of reason why I do not agree with this new change. The only positive reason I see is getting 3 days off. Another positive reason I see for this change is, if you get payed every 2 weeks, and you worked

4 days and, make 40 hours 1 week and 40 hours another week, it is going to be a good paycheck. Now it depends how much you get payed but im pretty sure if you are going to do 10 hours shifts, they are atleast going to pay $12.00 an hour or they are going to pay you $11.00 dollars in hour. Those would be good reasons to work in a job like that. It depends to if the people have time to work 10 hour shifts for 4 days.

Their are some school that want to have those same rules that some jobs have of 10 hours. I do not think that would work for students, because 10 hours of being in school is really stressing. I know how it feel like to be in school for 8 hours, is it is not fun and it is really stress full. I think that the classes in highschool would be more longer the students would not concentrate .The reason they would not concentrate is because, you would be doing a lot of asighnments and, you would lose intrest in what they are teaching and, you would lose focus. In my opinion I would not like that but I am pretty sure the school would like it because, they would be completing more work and they would be finishing lessons really quick and the students would study more.

There would be another advantage to that because the students would be in school for 10 hours for 4 days a week. They would have 3 days off every week that in my opinon it would propably be friday saturday and sunday. It would sound kind of good since you get 3 days off every week, but at the same time no students want to be in school for 10 hours for 4 days a week ,that sounds stressing and hard .You would propably have more classes, a lot of home work ,and more test, and quizes. It would propably be hard for teachers to do 10 hour shift to because ,they would have to do more planings of lessons because they would propably have to teach lot of classes during the day since the school day is 10 hours.

In my opinion this prompt that I wrote today was really intresting. The topic was really intresting it made me think a lot of what I was going to type in this prompt. The topic was really intresting because it was about what I thought about jobs only working 4 days a week and 10 hour shifts. The other part of the topic was what if school was 4 days and 10 hours.

6712BD512DB7,"I agreed that the greater of us lies and not in setting our aim high or low, but setting our aim too low will achieve our mark because many people around us are down and falling for some reasons. But, they are trying their best to climb up to the top in order to achieve their goals and learning from their mistakes. However, many others are lying or cheating to get a better score and failing down slowly. In fact, many people are working-hard to accomplish the goal that they want to achieve.

Setting our aim too low will achieve our goals because people have a weakness in their job and that's the reason why that they should be trying their best to fix their mistakes. I used to failed my math class last year because I didn't understand the unit because it's was too hard for me. So, I started to stay after school with my teacher and asking questions because I want to make sure that I understand the lesson. However, that didn't work out a lot as I expected because the assignment was different from what my teacher was explaining to me. But, I did not give up yet so I decided to study more at home and do some research about the lesson. And I finally understood the lesson. No matter how hard the work is, but what's important is that I put my time and efforts on it.

Another reason why setting our aim too low will help us achieve the goal is that by trying your best and work hard for it in order to achieve. However, many people are cheating to get the their goal so easily. My best friend got a high score on the test because he cheated and the test was hard as well. The teacher was wondered how did he got a high school on the test because he was the only one who got the highest score in the class, then he lied to my teacher that he studied a lot last night. But, the teacher caught him cheated on the test by using the notes because his answers was exactly as the notes said. So, it's not a shame that you are failing at something; but, it's a more worst that you lie to people and start falling down.

Also, setting our aim low will help us achieve the goal because many people are working-hard to get what they want. During the summer break, I told my mom that I want a new computer because my old computer is glitching and broken down a lot. Then, she told me that I work to earn money and get the new computer. She also said that it will helps me learn more things about the world. So, I started to work at a small restaurant and my position was cashier. It helps me counting the money faster and also it helps me improve my positives toward the other people.

Many people disagreed that setting our aim low won't help us to achieve our goal because sometime lying could be good for some reason and achieve the goal very easy. However, once the people find out that you're lying to them then you know the consequences. Sometime people starting at the lowest score to the highest score because they are doing their best of abilities to get the what they wanted to.

In conclusion, starting at the lowest point to the highest point will help you figure out what you need to do or learn in order to reach the goal. For example, if you don't try your best to achieve your goal and it's the worst thing that you could've ever done. However, the other are spreading lies to people how they achieve their goal easily and convincing people to be like them. But, keep trying your best and never give up to achieve your goal; then, you can get what you want.",3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.7686832,3.6213589,3.8381705,3.6891844,3.5221078,3.74525,3.4364424,3.378764,3.4214513,3.1622267,3.3713448,3.5380607,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,676,30,0.3520710059171598,22.53333333333333,6,6,"{'cheating', 'mom', 'disagreed', 'wo', 'cashier', 'positives'}"
5F8195FBA0CA,"Imagine schools use cell phones in classrooms for educational purposes, students will not have a hard time to find information on their classes. Schools should not allow students to use cell phones in classroom, this rule is important because cell phones are the distraction, students will have an opportunity to cheat on the test or the exam, and cell phones will cause the laziness, lack of knowlegde, and procrastination to students.

Certainly, some people think cell phones should be allowed in classroom because students can have a cell phones' break after finishing their test, they can enjoy some entertainments on the cell phones, some students will focus more on education with the musics on their cell phones. Others believe cell phones should be allowed in classroom because students can easily work on the projects, they can search for more information that they do not know much about. Still others argue cell phones should be allowed in classrooms because they will help some foreign students with the dictionary apps on the cell phones. Cell phones also help students in classrooms such as: reviewing notes by playing kahoot, some games' apps which include school knowlegdes.

However, schools should not allow students to use cell phones in classrooms because they are creating an opportuniy for students to cheat on the test or the exam. Students will definitely use the cell phones during the test in classroom if cell phones are allowed. For example, students usually take pictures of the answers and send them to the other students. The second reason of why they cheat is because everything can be easily saved and taken on the little smart cell phones, so why do students have to spend a hard time to study for the test ? They can just easily write down information on their test from the little smart cell phones, so what is the point of education? This rule is definitely unaccepted.

Furthermore, schools should not allow students to use cell phones in classrooms because the cell phones are the huge distraction. Imagine everybody is sitting quietly in classroom, and suddenly the little noise is popped up from the cell phone, catches a thousand of people's views. Of course no one likes being distracted but having the cell phones during classes is the huge mistake that causes the bad things to everybody around. For example, some students always play some unappropriate songs very loud while everybody else is taking the test, this situation always happens in every school. The second reason is the person who is with a cell phone, can attract the other one who sits beside, and interrupt other students' business.

Finally, schools should not allow students to use cell phones in classroom because they will cause the laziness, lack of knowlege, and procrastination to students. Students will keep messing on their cell phones, and ignoring the education, causing the lack of knowledge. Students will not absorb enough knowledge into their brain because they can just easily search for information on their cell phone without thinking critically of what they are doing. They can have the good results but actually they have nothing in their brain from school. The more schools allow students to use cell phones, the more they are worsening their students.

Cell phones should not be allowed for students to use in classrooms because cell phones are the huge distraction in classrooms, even in other public places, students will have an opportunity to cheat on the test or the exam using the cell phones, and cell phones will cause the laziness, lack of knowlegde, and procrastination to students. If the cell phones are allowed in every school, students will not need to go for education because everything is available to use on cell phones. Schools only need the real hard working, and the real quality from students, not from websites on cell phones. Every school should always have to think critically about the effects of allowing students to use cell phones in classrooms.",4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.8233385,3.6836886,3.8934894,3.747518,3.6080337,3.758735,3.6729228,2.6777475,3.6476834,3.2616427,2.4921255,2.8704321,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,666,26,0.3273273273273273,25.615384615384617,9,11,"{'catches', 'entertainments', 'websites', 'unaccepted', 'procrastination', 'cheat', 'worsening', 'distraction', 'exam', 'messing', 'laziness'}"
F5FF5E9E553C,"On september 2, 2015 Generic_Name was entering his first year of high school, and already knew what he wanted to do with his life, and that was to be a doctor, but was having trouble on what kind of doctor he wanted to be. So he decided to do some research on what kind of doctor he wanted to be before entering high school. Finally, Generic_Name decided he wanted to be, a surgeon. Took all of the classes he needed to be one. Few years later, became a surgeon, making lots of money, living in a nice house, and is living the best life he could dream of. In some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. Personally I think they should identify a career by the time they enter high school. So they can have the opportunities on what they need to do to get the job and not to be stressed out too much. Those are the reasons why they should commit to a career by the time they get to high school.

The first reason why they should identify a career by the time they enter high school is to have opportunities on what you need to get the job. In order to get the job, you need to go check out some places on what they do, so then you would know what to do. The other opportunity you have is you would know what classes you would need to take. For example, if you want to be a history teacher you basically just have to take most of the history classes, or if you want to be doctor you would basically take all sciene classes. The other opportunity is that if you want to make a lot of money have a plan set up. That's the reason why you should identify a career by the time you enter high school to have opportunities on what you need to get the job.

The second reason why they should identify a career by the time they enter high school is, so they don't get stressed out too much. If you know what you want to do then you're fine because the more you know the less stress you'll be in. If you know what you want to do then you'll be able to know what classes you will need to take, so then you won't have to take extra classes for no reason. Also if you need help don't hesitate to ask because everyone is here to help. The more you ask for help the less you'll be stressed. That's the reason why they should identify a career by the time they enter high school, so they don't get stressed out too much.

Some people would disagree with me because they think it's ok to wait to identify a career before they enter high school. They say that because they think high school is a place where you just hang out with friends, and not care about their grades when they should. Also, they think their interest in what they want to do will pop up eventually probably like in their senior year. No, that would be hard to figure out what college you would need to go to, don't even have a plan, and would just be stressed out.

In conclusion, in society they think that they should have an idea on a career by the time they enter high school. I strongly agree with that and there are many reasons why. So they can have opportunities on what you need to get the job, and that is know what classes you would need to take. Also, so they don't get too stressed out for it.

If you know what you want to do then you're fine because the more you know the less stress you'll be in. Those are the reasons why i agree with this statement.

2B9FE67B7465,"Thesis

: I believe that my school should not fallow this model because a lot of people get tired of school. Teachers get more tired than students because they work all year to make our classes and teachers need a break from school more than us, the students.

It is okay to go to the school the five days of the week. It doesn't matter how hard school is, if you go the five days of the week you get less tired because classes are more shortest and you don't have to be is school the whole day. Also you have more time outside of school to go to work or go with your friends to have fun and forget of school for a bit.

First, if schools do extend classes is gonna be more stressful and tired because you are going to be in school for a longest time and a lot of people don't even like school. Some people really hate school because is really hard for everyone and there are some classes that you don't even have an idea of what you are doing. Teachers know when someone is tired and they let them sleep for a while because maybe they know how is it feel being tired. Schools need to have the same schedule and don't change anything.

Second, schools are not like work in a job because in a job, you have more responsibilities and they also have rights that you need to comply. Being in a job is the double stressful and tired than being in your school learning a lot of new things. Some people say that work is better than go to school, but I say that they all are wrong because sometimes in school you do nothing, you just are listening to what the teacher says and in a job if you have a little break, you use it to eat or make another job that you need to do later.

They should not extend the school day but the should do it with jobs.

Third, if schools extend classes you won't have time to sleep well. That's the most important thing for students, sleep well to come to the school with a good attitude. A lot of people talk about other's attitude because they are always angry, bored, or lazy but they have no idea if they sleep well or not. Some people make fun of them because they fall to sleep in classroom and that's not right, the right thing is ask that person how is he feel, or if he is okay. The less you sleep, the most tired you get and sometimes you don't even can concentrate in classroom. Most of the students that don't sleep well and they have a job after school, they have a hard time in school because most of the times being in school is stressful as a job.

Conclusion

: Is not necessary to extend school day two more hours because it's gonna be the same any ways. Two more hours in four days don't change anything because is like you are adding Friday in that four days. The same eight hours in Friday, you are going to add to the four days of classes. They don't need to change anything because teachers won't have enough time to get ready our classes for the next day and they won't have time to even cook food at home or clean their house. Sometimes students above 18 years old live single and they need to work every single day because they need a lot of money to pay their bills like: house, car, phone, internet, food, and clothes. Some of them are about to have a baby and having a baby is a huge responsibility for him because he need to work over time to win more money or have two job. He is gonna be really really stressful and tired, and he won't have time to come to the school the whole day.",4.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5087256,3.3549092,3.5896983,3.4350798,3.2632675,3.4551067,2.7412798,2.6935358,3.0740206,2.7510998,2.4908333,3.3843017,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,689,26,0.3105950653120464,26.5,5,6,"{'shortest', 'stressful', 'fallow', 'wo', 'internet', '18'}"
011AAA636F11,"Have you ever solved a math problem in less than 30 seconds? Math is important to many people. Even president Trump uses math to buy food or pay back to important people. He might be paying people to find a cure for the Coronavirus. However did you know that we use math every single day in our life?

How do people use math every single day you may ask. When you go to the super market to buy food, the register has to add all the food that you bought and they even have to add taxes. How about when you go shopping in the mall with some friends. When some is looking for a job they even have to find out how much is the salary. When your parents pay water bills and taxes, they have to pay the perfect amount of money. If your doing a party you have to find how much money your wasting. In your school you have to use math in mostly all your subject. In science you have find out how much of a mass is in a cup of water then subtract it from the cup to find the mass of water. For history the president has to find out about expensive's and the taxes that each citizens is paying. If you have a hobby or have talents to do an activity you even use math. In theater arts you have to measure and subtract where the lights are hitting and you have to find the perfect angel. In baking you have to add your ingredients and weight it to find it's mass.

When you cook don't tell me you just put random stuff in your pot. You have to find the perfect amount to feed the people you are feeding. In soccer you have to find the angle you are going to kick the soccer ball. Basketball is the same, you have to see from which angel you are going to throw the ball to make a point for your team. Here are some school activity's that you use math in your school.

However several kid's don't like math but they could try it in a fun way. Many children complain about math being to hard or just being boring. I have found a way to make it exciting for kids. They could be playing games or just pretending to buy stuff, like doing a little play that won't cost money. If a student likes painting give them a coloring book that has math in it. Dancing and music is the same thing like coloring. In music you can count how many strings a violin has and compare it to another instrument that is in the violin family. You can watch a funny video that is related to math, you can watch it in your home or in school. Go on a field trip that will be free or that won't cost that much money.

If a student is struggling in math help or show them a way to do it. A kid's classmates or friend could help them in math. They can use math websites like racing cars for boys and coloring games for girls. If they are still struggling then ask there parents if they can stay or to get them a tutor after school. Find them a easier and understandable way to teach them math. The child's teacher can even play fun games with her students like Kahoot,Quizlet live, or even Pear Deck. You can give out prizes like candy or sticker's, that will probably get them more exciting.

Many scientist say that math is helpful to your brain and makes it healthy for you and your brain. You will acknowledge many ways to solve several math problems from years to years until you graduate from collage or high school. The reason why I choose to do my lesson about math is that I want kids to be independent and to get responsible when they grow up to be adults.

67D58F9FA53C,"I agree with the principal because that what he said said all students hood at lest participate on a sport,club,or after school activitis. The principal wants students tp join sports maybe because he want some students to get on shape or to atend some after school activitis for example like a dance club to see how students do and art club to see how students draw and students council. The yearbook like take pictures of all the teams,clubs,or groups the school has. or take photographs of all the teachers of the school like put what they do or what they teach students. School coincuals like take a photographs of them and write on the top what they do there names favoryte thing and others. And sports i do agree with the principal is for students can learn to do team work conumect with others and trying there best to win or at list not loss the game that's how they can learn and it shows the teacher how good there in one thing then the other

.And students council i don't now what that is or what it means but i think if like to help keep the school or help janutors, teachers,or the principal with something. And i agree again becaude people or example students need to get on shape learn how working out feels like and then when they grow older they would be like ""wow"" because school is not just learning math sciences sociol studes and laugen arts no,school is a aportuniti to now how life is and how it is ti work hard and trying our best to do or conplet something on life. Okay this off the topic that we are talking about okay, all most every billoner drop of of school and collage to start what they wanted to do and what there dream was the did not stop it they all went for it

Okay now this is back on the topic. I also disagree because some students need to do some at home like help there father or a family member o something of life or have to work in a reasterunt to help there family with bills or other thing like that is why some don't have the time to do any of dos after school activitis and others,or have to take care of a sibiling or a family member and don't have the time to stat for after school activitis for the cause of dos thing that I just said. And i disagree inone thing again some students just stay after school to finish a test,work,progetor a asy for the teacher or just stay to learn more about what there wanna do of the work or esy is wanna be about. But in one thing some not all students some hood really stay after like the ones that can't speak english, or the ones who need help on writing on english,or the ones who really need help to read on english .

Or the ones that want to learn more about a other laenguech they can just stay in the same class that they have the leangucj they want to learn about and just tell the teacher if they can stay after or not no if the teacher is gonna stay after for then they can stay after and learn more of the leanguch they are learning about. The students that are in sports they can just stay after pratising with other students on the soccer filled. And for the student council students can just do what the student council dos because i have no idia what is or what it means .

So what I am trying to say is that yes some students hood stay after school to participate on one of this activitys the principal has probited for them i can help them on soemthing not like help them alot but just a little for the students know how it is to do something.",2.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.4715862,2.3334854,2.74581,2.4849734,2.2916195,2.2243671,2.7316346,2.4602962,2.9325104,2.327873,2.3126545,2.4852636,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.5,2.0,683,15,0.3133235724743777,45.53333333333333,35,6,"{'yearbook', 'dos', 'soccer', 'wan', 'wow', 'ti'}"
F06D9612B900,"One activity i consider really enjoyable are science experiments . One of the reasons i consider these activities fun is because they are different from other types of projects . And what i mean by this is that for example when one does a math project or a language arts project is nothing more then doing many math exercises or writing an essay . Unlike the science projects for example one time i got to see a frog's interior . And it might sound desgusting to many of the people reading this and to be honest it did'nt smell good either . But one of the things that facinated me from the project it was that frogs dont have as many organs as we human's do . Or maybe they removed some of them but there wasn't a lot of organs in there

And another thing i was curious about was that they were different colors . i remember seeing blue and pink unlike us humans almost all of our insides are red . Frogs actually got different colors in their interior but they looked a little dry because my teacher told me that they have been frozen for some time . But it defenently made it easier to cut parts in the interior of the frog . And also sense my teacher told me that we were able to cut whatever we wanted me and my group tried to explore as much as possible . But there was a part that was really desgusting which was that there was some flies in the frog's stomach . And that part definently disgusted me but it didn't made me want to stop either.

After we finished trying to see everything inside the frog the teacher told us the name and function of each of the parts of the frog . But one of my friend decided it was silly to poke the frog's eye . And until this point i still dont know what went trough his mind in that exact moment . But wen he poke it , it resulted that the frog's eye was'nt completly frozen so liquid from the eye just came rushing out and he got wet because he decided to do that . Fortunently it did'nt reach me but it defenently reach my mate . After that the teacher send him to the bathroom to wash himself .

After that happened my teacher decided that it was best to just stop the project after that . But it was defenently a lot of fun .

Another example of a project was recently when my tacher decided to have us do a project in the dark because is themed to what we are learning about right now . Which is the unit of light and the project was really simple and to be honest it wasn't as amazing and funny as the other project . But it was to spray a liquid in front a flashlight . And what was supposed to happen was that i would be able to see the waves which light travels on . And after the teacher explained the process of how this happens she told us to spray the liquid in front of the flashlight and being honest i didn't see anything i was kind of dissapointed . But after four seconds i could see them and they were kind off hard to see and it was for some few seconds but i actually enjoyed the project . But it had some downs like it was really short and the teacher took forever to explain the process . But i still think it was a really interesting project .

And what i tried to show by showing you this examples from my own personal experiences is that . Science experiments are not always boring and you may not like them but you should give them a chance . And i promise you that you are going to like them or at least one of the many projects there is . Because they make class a little more interesting . And in my opinion projects or experiments are the best activities there is in the school . Beacause they teach you in a more directs type of learning . And that's why i think they are the best .

6FDAD6124B9E,"Ever since you were little, have you ever noticed that your really good at something as you grew over time? Everyone has a talent or a skill that are common or very unique. I have gained a talent over years and I just realized not to long ago. My number one talent I have it dancing hip-hop because I took classes for 9 years and I got inspired by the artist I mostly love.

My number one talent is hip-hop. Hip-hop's really been a big part of my dancing life over years. I took classes at a place and just remembered having so much fun and learning new dance moves. Since I started taking classes of hip-hop and learning new things, I thought that this might be the number one thing I might actually be good at. I have once broken my ankle by learning a new dance move. The bone was out of place and the bone was a bit cracked. At that moment I was just thinking about the pain but once I got home and was able to rest, I just had the fear of not being able to dance and it made my heart shatter into 7. After a 8 or 9 weeks I felt better and was able to dance again. I had to be careful and not hurt myself again. when I first got there I was not a good dancer like most of them. Once I was there for almost a year I learned a lot because they would tell me little secrets of their's. I got better ever since and now I teach my closest friend how to dance. I took dance class for 9 years and it helped me a lot with my dancing skills.

I got inspired by the artist I love the most. Ever since 2012 December 22 I found a group of boys that were new. I watched their video's and I was in love with them. They debuted in 2013 June 13 with their first song called ""No More Dream"". They were called BTS. There are a seven member group, there stage names are RM, Jin, Suga, J-hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook. They are a band from South Korea. Their fan's are called ARMY. As years passed by and they became the biggest boy band in the whole universe and galaxy! I was inspired by their music but also their dancing, which got me more into dancing. I learned all their dance moves from their music video's to their stage performances. They also inspired me to dance more because ever since I was little I liked dancing and over the years I got better, they kept telling me to keep going which I did and that's when I made up my mind. I was now planning to become a back up dancer for them when they went on tour. I was planning to already become a dancer so I practiced more. When I became 13 I was able to dance and more like some one was controlling me with strings, like I was a puppet.

Now that I am 14 I decided to teach others who wanted to learn how to dance. It's been 9 years of dancing so why not. After learning to dance hip-hop I felt like an animal that's been let back in the wild. Dancing is a big part of life if you love it and enjoy it. BTS has taught people many things but the one line they said about dancing is ""There are 2 deaths in life. The first one is when you lose the passion of music and dance and the second one is death. The first death though is more painful."" Those are not the exact but very close to the meaning. My number one talent is dancing hip-hop because I took classes for 9 years and I got inspired but the artiest I love the most. What's the one talent that you have, do you actually want to become better or move on.",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.757279,3.7232199,3.9272735,3.8257291,3.7677462,3.7741575,3.5432343,4.13904,4.3051925,4.3157983,3.9736505,3.5626597,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,684,42,0.3801169590643274,16.285714285714285,11,14,"{'13', 'shatter', '2012', '22', 'galaxy', 'artiest', '7', 'video', '14', '2013', '9', '2', 'debuted', '8'}"
BB8064D7B327,"My friend is home schooled because she use to get bullied a lot so she wanted to drop out, she could'nt deal with it anymore. Her counselor gave her a better option taking online classes because she had very good grades and she wanted her to graduate and have a good future. In some schools they offer distant learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I think getting home schooled is a good benefit for students who have situations at school, for student drop outs, and it's easier and quicker.

The primary reason on why it's a good benefit, it's that it helps you if you have bad situations at school such as you always get into fights with other students, you are getting harassed or bullied, you have problems with your teachers, or you think you're wasting your time and you could be working and getting money. Having online classes can help you stay out of trouble or helps you stop what ever you are dealing with. Not only it stops the situation but can help you improve and graduating with no problem. If you are having problems talk to your counselor and ask for a possibility for online classes or your parents if you can get home schooled.

Secondly, it benefits the students who are dropping out of school. Most of the students who are dropping out are for financial reasons like, they want to help there family so, they drop out and start working or some teens get pregnant at a young age and there parents most likely they dont support them or help them in anything that they need so, it causes them to drop out. It helps them further there knowledge and can possibly get a better job. It makes them feel happy knowing they can finish school because they know they already making a decision by dropping out but they can still graduate by taking online classes. I remember when i was at student counseling aide and one day a student came to ask me where should he leave his laptop because he was planning to drop out, he looked upset. Generic_Name ask him why? he answered ""i wanna help my family out they dont have any money right now"" she gave him an option for online classes he didnt know it was possible to do that and It made him happy.

Finally, getting home schooled is easier and quicker. You can take your classes when ever you are free. If you need to take a break, you can and continue when ever you are ready. it's non-stressful comparing to regular school. Its proven that getting home schooled its less stressful than regular school. Generic_Name is a science teacher at SCHOOL_NAME he said ""88% students are stressed about school because of homework and not having to finish assignments on time"". He also said ""only 5% are stressed when they are home schooled"". In conclusion, it's less stressful and help you feel non-pressured while you are taking your online classes. It also, gives you free time and gives you advantage to do what ever you like. You get to be home and relax wake up when ever you like to, do your classes take brakes if you would like to, too me it sounds amazing!

Some people might say that getting home schooled is bad because if you have any questions you dont have a teacher to ask or a physical teacher to help you understand the topic you are learning about but it's a one on one class. There's no students just you and your instructor, it helps you focus which i personally think it will help you more comparing sitting in a class room with your friends not paying attention, playing around or not getting work done. I think it's a good benefit having online classes because it helps with people who have bad situations at school, people who are planning to drop out and its a fast and easier way to get your classes done.",4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.4072413,3.2720468,3.5275626,3.4335372,3.283806,3.2779284,3.8328412,3.7904909,3.7701375,3.6949284,3.8090925,3.505218,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,694,28,0.3789625360230547,24.785714285714285,10,12,"{'88', 'bullied', 'schooled', 'outs', 'conferencing', 'homework', '5', 'stressful', 'video', 'laptop', 'online', 'wan'}"
E80C88E9837C,"I agree with Churchill' statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of succes, because the way to become to the success is not gonna be easy. All the people that try to have a good success they gonna have failure on the way and sometime they fall apart, but they never have to loss their enthusianm, because the succes consists in fall apart and wake up again, and keep going looking for a good success that gonna be graet for their life and their family gonna be haughty of them.

I agree because, the life gonna put many impediment to have a good success we have to keep going do not have to loss aur enthusiasm, for example. My family came of a poor family, but I have an ancle that he never loss his enthusiasm of has a good success, so he worked too hard for it. One failure that he has on his way to the succes was the poorness, but he keep going wrestlering for get uot of the poorness and help his father and mother, one day he found a job and begin to meke money and his first thing that he made was to buy a bed for him, then he to begin to save money to come to this country, now he has a lot money in his bank account because he put his own company of landscaping, but he never loss his enthusiasm about his success.

I agree with this statement, because there is a lot example of how the people have many failure and they keep going never loss their enthusiasm of their success, one of this example is of one soccer player his name is Cristiano Ronaldo. He is a famous soccer player, but to have a great success he had many failure one of thase failure was that his father died when hi was a kid it was hard for him even has to see a psychologist and he to overcome that, he keep going looking for his success, but he failure again because the people and couche's that saw him, don't believe him they say like he doesn't has future, but he keep work in his success and show to all the people that don't believe him that they was wrong. Because he has a future and he gonna has a great success, now he is the best soccer player in the world for many people, but he always worked so hard to get out of the failure and he to obtain a good success.

I agree with Mister Churchill, because the way for a great success is gonna be long and we gonna have many filure to obtain this, for example. I am trying to graduate from high school, but one of failure was that it is not been easy for me, because this is a new language for me and it is dificult to talk, but I keeping going trying to get my diploma , another failure is that I have to work for pay may rent and buy my own stuff, shoes, clothes, and food, it make more dificult to have my success, but I know that success consists on fall apart and wake up, but I never loss my enthusiasm of to be graduate from high school. One day I gonna say that my success wasn't easy but I obtain a good success.

In Conclution I agree with ""churchill's statement about success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". I agree with him because on the way to a great success we gonna have many failure but we don'thave to loss our enthusiasm, because in the world there is a lot people that they never loss their enthusiasm, even when they have a failure they always weke up and keek going, now they have a good success, so if we want a great success in our life we have to keep going wrestlering with all the failure that we gonna have. One day we gonna say I made it and we gonna have a great success.

BE68C5AB58A1,"Having you wonder why people able to accomplish so much just in few days? Today society people always works so much they miss out their opportunity in life. Although some might argue that, it is better to does inactivity also serve a purpose, actually it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something because can lead successful and you gain experience.

It is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something can lead to successful. Thomas Jefferson say it is always good do something. For example,My uncle when my came to united States he always do somethings with his hand such as construction and fix people car my uncle always doing somethings new if thous wasn't good them but tried able to accomplish them as such files tax for people he was able accomplish them.

My uncle now files tax people get pay a lots;

when people do not know how files tax they came to him files for them by that he was successful because he accomplish more if always doing somethings now he has own company where people work for him. He always advisory worker in order for you to successful always do somethings new. This show that it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something. Another example, it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing lead successful for example,Bill Gate who always doing somethings he was the first person to create Microsoft.

Bill Gate like always like do somethings with computer. He was successful because he always like to do somethings

Bill Gate was rich man on the whole world today because he always do somethings build computer. This show that it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something because can lead successful

It is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you gain experience. for example, my brother who was doing somethings he able to accomplish more things. The first my brother do his internship how to construction wasn't good at all but he was also keep doing it instill he was able accomplish it now he know to how to fix roof and many more things he is expert construction build. This that It is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you gain experience. Another example I wasn't good at Algebra at all I was fail the class also Got F on classwork and test to

I decide to stay after with teacher start practical math question I understand little by little but the first take my math test able pass test got B on the test my first every to got B on math. I use thought that wasn't at my math class but always do somethings in my class able to gain experience in class. This show that

It is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you gain experience.

The other side claim that it is better to does inactivity also serve a purpose, because you can be more wise about around you however it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you can learned for example, when my mom came to American she did not know how to speak English. She always practical how to read in English and write English. She was able to accomplish that because she always somethings with English leaned how speak English. This show that is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you can learned.

Another example It is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you can learned . Always doing something you can learned from it for example I did not know how to cook anythings any time put dish on fire never come out good but when always keep cook it start to turnout good I was able accomplish always something new with my dish.

Finally it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something because can lead successful and you gain experience. Although some might argue that, it is better to does inactivity also serve a purpose they are wrongs. Never stop trying something new in life it will turn out be more successful then you never to be expected.

F530741D2297,"Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much can be done if we are always doing."" Jefferson's quote is accurate because we can not accomplish something without doing something in life. Everyone has a goal in life; to meet those goals we have to prepare and take steps to complete them. Some people may say that inactivity can also serve a purpose because there are people, including: famous people, family members, or teachers who has once been passionate about something they have done in their lives who quit and became someone bigger, but they are wrong. There is a lot that can be done and steps to take if we are always doing something for ourselves or for others because instead of doing nothing we can focus on our education to help us in the future or to make this world a better and wonderful place for everyone.

For starters, when students focus on their education all the time there is a lot that can be done. One reason why students can do so much with our education is because often education can prepare us for a big exams. For example, in class students are learning and reviewing different tropics repeatedly, which will help us pass any exams that will be given to us. This proves that when students are constantly learning something they can accomplish anything that they were leaning or reviewing throughout the year. This shows students how much they have done by focusing, instead of doing nothing. Another reason why students can do so much with their education is because it can help them graduate and accomplish bigger things in life. For example, most students that are always on task and doing everything that they should be doing have bigger plans in life than those who do not. This proves that students that accomplish more by being on task with their education will graduate with a future ahead of them. As a result, students that are focus and on task are more likely to feel incredible for everything they have accomplished in their education.

Second, a lot of people around the world can do so much to help other communities by volunteering and to make this world a better place. A reason why it is wonderful how much can be done if we are always doing something is because we can help those around us. For instances, there is a lot of people around the world that need our help, such as homeless people or families who live poor. We as a community can feed those who are homeless or can help families who need help with jobs or to get health insurance. This shows, that if we gather together as a group we can see how much we have done to help these people in need. Another reason to see how much we can do together is by making great choices in life. For example, we can plant fruits and vegetables and give them out for free to help people around us to consider to make better food choices. As a result, there is many opportunities we can take to make this world become a better place for everyone. We can only accomplish a lot by doing everything in our power to make better this world a better place.

In Jefferson's quote, he was saying that we can do so much by doing something and it is true. If we put our mind into something and do everything we can to accomplish what we have in mind we can do anything, but if we just sit there doing nothing, we will not have the outcome we expected to want. Everyone lives in different ways, but it is important to see what each of us individuals can accomplish in life. The only way we can graduate is by focusing and staying on task. Some may see the see the world as being lazy, but we can change that by helping out and planning something together as a group to make a change in the world. It is important that we are making a change for ourselves and our communities. These are some reason why we should always do something to get the outcome that we want to see.",4.0,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,3.9874823,3.9583318,4.1244016,4.0670667,3.9939342,4.041248,3.7470968,3.4713984,3.8342218,3.4846904,3.4936926,3.6085455,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,718,31,0.3105849582172701,23.161290322580644,3,6,"{'tropics', 'volunteering', 'exams', 'homeless', 'inactivity', 'starters'}"
BE4764F7BFF1,"The Downside of Online Classes

A couple of schools offer online classes through virtual videos and video conferencing for students to take from home. Some schools might think that students would benefit from this and others think that this is not a good idea. From my perspective, students would not benefit from taking online classes for many reasons such as; they could get distracted easily, they miss out interacting with teachers and students, and they would eventually get bored of online school at home.

To begin with, many students K though 12th grade get distracted easily. The distraction is not because we don't want to do the work, but it's our minds. Everyone's minds work in a different way and theres always going to be that part of us that gets distracted by the small things around us. Also, technology is somewhat of an issue because it distracts many people because of the games and many apps that it has. Students could go off task and go off playing games or watching videos while they are supposed to be learning and doing their work online. For example, sometimes even I get distracted while doing my work at home through my computer or smart device because of the many other things I could be doing instead of doing homework. There are many distractions online and around us that could make us go off task instead of keeping us focused to do our work.

Furthermore, many students would miss out on interacting with other students, teachers, and staff. In other words, when you are taking online classes the only person there with you would be your teacher, whom is communicating with you through your computer. No one else would be there with you to help you through it, everything would have to be on your own. Ultimately, if you are in a school many teachers and students would be there to assist you with any questions or concerns that you might have. Also, you would miss out on a lot more exciting events such as school dances,

football games, and pep rallies. There is so much that you would miss out if you wouldn't go to a public school and decided to take online school instead.

Ultimately, you would also be spending almost all day in your house because of online classes. A regular school day is about 8 hours, meaning the online classes would be about the same time , or more or less. In school 8 hours is already tiring enough because of the learning and listening, but think of 8 hours at home with no breaks in between, that would be extremely exhausting. Almost all students that attend school come for a full 8 hour day, which includes break in between classes, then once school is over they go back home to be able to relax. If you are at home for 8 hours doing work, you wouldn't want to spend time relaxing at your home because eventually it would get boring there after a while. In my experience being at home gets boring to the point where I don't know what else to do to not be bored at home. In other words, being in the same place for a whole day would get boring and uncomfortable.

On the other hand, other schools claim that it is a good idea for students to take online classes. They are in favor of taking online classes through video conferencing. Some of the schools think that online classes are a good idea because many students could possibly avoid drama, get 1 on 1 assistance, and learn quicker. Although some of it is true, online classes should not be necessary. Online school should only be necessary if a student does not feel safe at their school because of personal reasons.

Overall, online classes are not a good idea at all unless it is necessary because of safety issues. Besides that, it would not be a good idea because many students would get distracted when they are supposed to be doing work, students would miss out on interacting with other students, teachers, and staff, and they would spend most of their day at home which is unhealthy.",5.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.0564823,4.0515594,4.1752243,4.1328254,4.184692,4.05084,3.3617938,3.5214353,3.6492367,3.3682516,3.1215696,3.4157815,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,709,30,0.3526093088857546,23.633333333333333,5,15,"{'1', 'homework', 'conferencing', 'downside', 'interacting', 'video', 'rallies', 'online', 'distractions', 'distracts', 'distraction', 'exhausting', 'videos', 'pep', '8'}"
524CD617574D,"Do you think success consists of going from failure to failure? Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" In my opinion, when you want to reach your goal or your dream you can fail or success but you shouldn't never give up you should keep trying till you reach your goal. So, I do not agree with Churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of the success. There's no people that hasn't failed in his/her life at least once but there are some that did success, you only have to work really hard or fight for what you want, and you shouldn never loss your enthusiasm, that is something that people should never forget, to have enthusiasm for something.

First, there is not people that has not failed at least once in their whole life. In this world there is a lot of people that had mistaken, failed or disappointed. For example in their goal, getting a job, not getting good grades in school, not succeeding and etc. there is no perfect people that hasn't make any mistake. Failing does not always have to be about your personal life. You could fail your family or friends just by lying them or disappointing them. Maybe there are some people that hasn't failed just few like 1%. I do said this because my cousin, she has never disappointed or failed their parents she has really good grades and have a higher score in school she already graduated with a scholarship. Now she is in Virginia Tech University.

In order to reach your goal or your dream, you have to work really hard to success. If you had failed once or more do not get sad or depressed yourself you are strong enough to handle it. There is always an opportunity or another chance that life will give you. Work hard you should never give up easily, fight for what you want reach your big dream. Life is not easy life is hard no one ever has said that life was easy if you want something you have to work hard for it, I know you get drop down(sad) by failing in something but you can get up. If you can't success in something make another plans there is a lot to do and another opportunities that you can get, do not just get stuck in one thing. Look for other things that you want and maybe you will like it and enjoy it.

People in this world should never lose their enthusiasm. You are enthusiasm for something go for it do not let other people to do that for you or take it. Enthusiasm is something to appreciate and work hard for it. Not everyone is enthusiasm they dont have that; that interest, that strong warmth of feeling, or that inspired of something you would love to do or have. Be proud of yourself if you are enthusiastic for something. People without it has no feeling for something they don't care about their lives or future they only get what they can do for it, they don't give their feeling for it. They accept what they get. For Instance, when I was a kid I use to be really good at my school I was the best student with good grades, but when I moved here to US I had to start again because I didnt know any English so to success with my English I really had to work hard.

In conclusion, I do not agree with Churchill's statement. Success does not have to consists of going from failure to failure. You do fail a lot of times but If you don't give up and work really hard you can success for your goal or your big dream. Just never lose the enthusiasm that you have for something, that keeps you up for it, the warmth feeling you have the inspire and interest for it is strong so don't give up. Always work hard for what you want and you will success. Life isn't easy not even for reach people.

Most of the time they can be just a sit and write. But sometimes they are really fun to do with your friends. It can be a play and you can have tons of fun doing that. Also it's good for you and your grade so it is a win win.

Most of the time people have good time with their projects and enjoy doing them to score better in their grade. Sometimes we all get projects like building explosive volcano at A science fair. Also projects like going on A field trip to A museum to get info about the World War 2 for Social Studies. Project can be fun when done with A friend or with just A project buddy. You can also do much more with help from A teacher. It can be fun to show your project in front of the class. Some people like to be constant with their grade so that is what they do.

A play can be fun, you can dance, reenact characters, and even just do a reality play. Or you can dress up as a character. Science experiments are really fun to deal with chemicals and to see chemical reactions. It can be fun to play an in interment and to play out loud to the crowd. With your friends and be playing your interment with you. You can do so much with playing an interment and it can be fun at the same time. Playing an interment can be a lot of fun playing for an audience and it can be fun hearing what sound you are creating. Sometimes you can just work with the music and play with a friend and maybe crate a song and play it. You can spend good time with creating a song and playing it with your friends. It can also be fun by doing it and playing in front of the whole class. Going to different places to perform is kinda cool and fun traveling. Music is A lot of fun when you are doing it with A friend or a teacher. I think project can be a great way to show creativity. The more the interment gets played the more the project will get more fun to play with your friends. The music is fun done with a partner as A project.

A concert can be A good place too play your music. A musician can direct the project. They can be really fun and enjoyable when it come to that. The musicians play the music it can be good for the enjoyment of the music that goes into you ear and the project letter can be an A+. You can also do stuff like playing your interment and doing a lot of stuff like that.

You can also lower your grade by not doing what you were assigned So u have to do the project assignment you are as were to do with your partner. Projects are kinda fun because you can let your mind be wild. So the project are really fun and easy A

Projects are kinda boring in a way but most people like to do them. In my opinion projects are done not to learn whats on it but to do the assignment and bring it in on time.

I think some people like to do there project to learn but i don't like them they are fun and enjoyable but it's not my thing.

Students can be more benefit if they attend to school and they can learn more than to did at home. Also there are many students can't come to school because they have a job and they have to did school at home. Students are not that much of prepare if they did school at home. If students could attend to school it can be great for them to be more able to did more prepared them for the future. Also that can get opportunities if they attend to school and good reviews from teachers.

If students attend to school there are more ways to learn. Also students can be more able to ask more question to teachers. If they did classes from home that are not able to ask a lot of question and they can't met friend who can be a big help for them. If you attend to school also teachers can prepared you more and they talk to you if you did wrong in classes. All teachers in school i believe that they can see your capacity or level that you are and at home they just give you work and they didn't know anything about the student. The teacher at school can see the way that you better learn and they can work with the student to don't fell classes because the know you better if you go to school. Home school is a great idea for people that can't come to school.

In the world are students that can't attend to a school because they have a job or others problems to go to school. In the world is not only one single reason to don't attend to school. Many of the students that can't attend to school in the United States of America is because they work and this work can't give opportunity to attend to school. Sometimes they don't attend to school because is hard to work and wake up in the mornings to go to school. They also many times prefer to do school at home because they maybe have physical problems and they feel better if they did at home. Many students can't come to school but if they did at home this shows that they are planing to graduate even if they don't receive a good chance to learn more.

Students at home are not learning what they can learn in school. They are not very prepared if they did school at home because sometimes teachers give activities with friends and students can learn from that activities or presentations of projects that the whole class did it. School also you can practice more if you are learning and at home you can't practice what you learn. If you are learning English and you did school at home if they speak other language that is not English you can't practice it. If you did school at home there are also many distractions that you can't concentrate and if you are not concentrated in what your working on you are not going to understand what you are doing. If you are in a classroom teachers make sure that you are concentrated in your own work and they also make sure that you are doing right that why students who attend to schools can be more prepared than students who did school at home.

In conclusion if you have time and the opportunity to attend to school you should do it because you will learn and get more opportunities. If you can't attend to a school and you are doing school at home you must concentrated in your work and don't get distracted. Also if you are receiving school at home you must find some one who you can work with to practice. The opportunity that many school offer is a great idea. School wants to students can complete their dreams even if they can't assist to a school. But the schools are giving opportunities to finish at home and must students should appreciate that because school is thinking about the future of the society. In fact school programs are working for people who really want to have opportunities and make their dreams true.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.5,3.1751196,2.9862764,3.275805,3.0697525,2.8324423,3.10494,3.273121,3.325129,3.1692097,2.755275,2.9641194,3.452219,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,744,32,0.2432795698924731,23.25,2,3,"{'options', 'distractions', 'planing'}"
9C601D9FCB5F,"Technology is an important thing in our lives at this moment and it will be more important in the future. Humanity always try to look forward for what is better for our lives and make everything more easier. While some people say this is a good thing, some people think it's bad for our lives because people stop interacting face-to-face in public, they don't want to get out of the place where technology is at, and some might have an agressive behaivor when they told them technology is bad for them.

In the past people always met in the street, there was no technology were with a single ring we can saw our friends into a little screen and talk to them. Now, this problem became a bad thing in our society, people don't go outside to meet friends, or just enjoy how the city looks, they prefer to stay at home and talk to people that they don't know who they are. Some of these people might say that there's no difference when they talk to a stranger online because we used to talk strangers in the street;however, there's a risk when you talk to this people online and it's the fact that some of them used fake accounts to hack personal information and other things. When we used to meet strangers in the street, we saw how they behave and what they're doing, and that's how people made friends in the past, saw how they act and behave,but now Internet is the key of making a friend that we don't know if it's real.

When we were kids it was all fun to play outside: in the streets,going to a friends house, or even going to the park with them, but now things have change a lot since we were those kids who played in the streets. Now with the new technology people made video games, and now is the popular thing between kids and teenagers. All we have to do is to connect the device to the TV and just play, but some people play the whole day and they don't want to go outside to play any sport, or going to a friends house. When they go to school the most common topic between every kid is about video games, and that can affect their lives because playing all the time won't help anyone to study for an important test,or doing their homework. In the past when they created the first console it was a wonderful thing, but some kids didn't have the enough money to buy it, so instead of save money for a tiny console, they save money to eat something like an ice cream, a burguer, and go to attraction parks,but now we can see how the kids and the teenagers from now don't want to get out where technology is at.

Due to the amount of technology we have now develop, a new behaivor where if we prohibited them to use technology, they reach to the point where they become agressive. Families have issues when their kids became agressive just because the prohibited the use of technology, and this reaction is trendy right now in different parts of the world. Some doctors said that the reason why they react like that is because they are in an imaginary world where they can do whatever they want, until the parent try to take apart their""world"" to become a normal kid, but now that technology is in every single corner, it's hard to make a kid stop use technology. Even teenagers went to a ponit when they are playing video games they break everything they got on their sight, including the video game device that their parents bought for them.

Some people might say that technology is something positive in our live because we create artifacts that make our lives more simple;however, technology is bad in our lives because we stop acting like normal people and we want to make our lives more easy, and that can affect how our saciety can be in the future if we don't control the use of technology.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.6085892,3.4372387,3.729549,3.5396652,3.338349,3.495478,3.302735,3.2177162,3.7686744,3.3513284,2.818038,3.0754442,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,714,17,0.3487394957983193,42.0,10,11,"{'interacting', 'hack', 'video', 'trendy', 'connect', 'artifacts', 'online', 'internet', 'wo', 'homework', 'console'}"
F84E5DEFC874,"Have you ever just sat down and thought, Do we really accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? Some say sayings have a reason for example Thomas Jefferson wrote ""Determine never to be idle... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something"", Does this mean it is true because he said it? Or is it just something he wrote because it was his opinion?

I strongly agree with what Thomas Jefferson wrote, it's saying in little words don't be lazy, it's amazing how much can get done if we are always doing something. If we are always doing something other than what we want to accomplish it takes time and the process just gets longer. I believe that inactivity serves a purpose even though your inactive or active some or many things can be accomplished.

One reason I believe that inactivity serves a purpose is because, more can be accomplished when you are not active and working. I have experienced this numerous of times at my job. At my job,

we have task we have to get done by a certain time which is closing and sometimes those task don't get done due to how busy the store gets, when the store gets busy we can't get what we want accomplished, but say we are not active, or working and the place gets slow and calm. We have the time to get our task done and meet the requirements and leaving on time. When you are super active and busy it get hectic and that just adds more to your tasks. For example your making some food, drinks and theres more and more orders, you can't make something then clean your gonna have to keep going and clean it all up at the end when it slows down. In my opinion you get what you want accomplished when your less active in this case.

Another reason I believe that inactivity serves a purpose is because, when your not active you don't know what your gonna accomplish that day, but out of boredom your gonna get something out of it. This happens to me all the time where one day i'm just free all day with absolutely nothing to do, and i just lay in bed with a mess in my room not even thinking about the mess and all of a sudden I start cleaning everything and organizing everything. Like Thomas Jefferson says ""Determine never to be lazy... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something"" In this case it works both ways because if your doing something you get something accomplished and something good out of it, but if your doing absolutely nothing then you get nothing accomplished.

Lastly I believe that inactivity serves a purpose because, say your going to try out for the boys or girls soccer team and there is only 1 spot left. Obviously your going to need to practice everyday and know how to play. Practice makes perfect the more active you are with soccer, the more chances your gonna get that last spot to be a member of the soccer team, but say you really want the last spot but your just not as good as the others and it's a new sport you just wanna try out but you are not practicing everyday to get better. If you don't practice everyday to get better then there are less chances of you making that last spot just because you weren't as active and on it like the others. The more practice you receive the more chances you will have to get that last spot because of the dedication with no activity done theres no hope in that.

In conclusion, inactive or active you get through your day and learn something new and that is a accomplishment so much can be done in many different situations, anything is possible. At one point through your day you accomplish making it through even if you felt like you didn't accomplish anything you must have, because you learn something new that is the biggest accomplishment. Thomas Jefferson said that for a reason for sure. Everything has a meaning and reason behind it.

5AC1AB0965F6,"Ever since I was little I would dreamed of going to Hawaii. I would always think of seeing the beautiful crystal clear blue seas. I would want to go scuba diving and get a view of the animals in the ocean.

reasons why I would want to go to Hawaii because it has a huge water park. I always have fun at water parks because it has big slides and big pools and other fun stuff. But Hawaii water park is like three times the size of the water parks I've been in. During the summer I like to go to my pool and spend my time there. I always wished I had a slide in my pool. But my pool is still fun. I invite my friends to make the pool more fun. We play sharks and Minos and other games.

Another reason why I would go to Hawaii is because I want to try out their sea food. I heard their sea food is really good and it come fresh out the ocean. Personally my favorite sea food is crab. But i like crab better when its a crab soup.

One more important reason why I would want to go to Hawaii is because I want to spend time with my family. I rarely get to spend anytime with my family. The reason that is because I have to go to school and my work and stuff. Then my when i comeback home my dad has to go to work. He comes back around midnight. So basically I never get to see him. I probably see him like for 10 minutes but then I cant. At least I get to see him during holidays.

The first thing I would want to do when I get to Hawaii is go to the huge water park. I want to go there to have fun. I also want to ride all the slides in the park. I want to play around with my family and have fun with them. Me and my dad always go on big slides when we're in a water park.

Another activity I would want to do when I get there is ride a bike around the city i'm gonna be staying at. I want to get to know the city and all of its locations. I also would love to ride on the mountains so i can get a nice view and take some photos.

Something else I would do is swim in the crystal clear oceans with my family. I have never seen my feet when i'm in the ocean and i want to experience that. I also want to have fun throwing a ball around with my family.

The first things I would want to see in Hawaii is go scuba diving and get to see the beautiful sea creatures swim around the ocean. Also for reason I want to get to touch them, and I want to see my families reaction. I always wanted to sea wild sea creatures. I never get to sea them because the closest ocean to me is dirty so you cant see nothing under the water. I want to see them swimming around and see other animals in the water. Every time I see a sea creature. The only way I would see one is if I caught it with a fishing rod or its dead on the sand or In the aquarium.

I would really want to go on a helicopter and see all of Hawaii. I just want to explore and get a beautiful view of Hawaii. At least see two dolphins hop from the ocean. That would be a perfect moment. But I just want to see Hawaii. I would probably go see one of does fire performance too.

One more thing I would want to go see in Hawaii is my family having fun. I want to see them having fun because I rarely get to see them having fun. We usually don't have fun because were not always together. One of my family membesr has to work and the other has to do something else. I really wished we could spend time longer together.

I would go to Hawaii because I get to increase the relationship with my family and have fun. If I got to Hawaii i'm not be stressed out during that time.",3.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.582012,3.4997067,3.650001,3.5664363,3.4764805,3.546206,2.6187854,3.7103279,3.8348634,3.2873454,2.982679,2.7281692,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,739,54,0.3071718538565629,13.685185185185183,9,12,"{'sharks', 'scuba', 'crab', 'comeback', 'bike', 'aquarium', 'oceans', 'cant', 'anytime', '10', 'hop', 'helicopter'}"

03CC97D3747E,"Many schools have partner ships with companies that can allow students to explore certain occupations through internships and shadowing opportunities to discover whether they are interested in pursuing that type of employment. In my opinion its a good idea to allow students to explore certain occupations through internships and to discover whether they are interested or not. By allowing them to visit and explore, they are most likely to know what they want in life and in their upcoming future, and they can get a good job that pays money in the future.

The first reason as to why it is a good idea to explore certain occupations through internships is because, students will most likely know what they really want to do in life and it will help them start a good future. I have a cousin named Generic_Name, he has three kids named Generic_Name, Generic_Name, and Generic_Name. Believe it or not Generic_Name was chosen to go to Liberty University a few years ago. He went to the College to see if anything they taught was interesting. A few months later, Generic_Name started going to Liberty for a few years and finished off with straight A's. Today he owns his own business, and he is happy as ever.

The second reason why it is good to explore certain occupations through internships is because, you are willing to get a good job that pays very well. I have another cousin named Generic_Name, He is the strongest and most bravest person I have ever met. Generic_Name is the AirForce, he joined the air force a few years ago. He loved it there although he said it was somewhat rough. He went to the AirForce because his parents didnt have enough money for him to go to college. After leaving the AirForce he chose to go to Liberty University as well, He absolutely loved it there. He graduated in 2015. He is now working for the FBI and I could not be any prouder of him then I am right now. A few weeks ago I went over to his house and he said ""Generic_Name when i was in the AirForce it was rough for me, I felt like it was useless. Now i know that god put me in that position, because he wanted something big for me. I feel like i'm on top of the world I have never felt any better then I do today. I also have so much money too, thanks to the job i have they pay really well. One of these days I want to buy a mansion."" I saw tears coming out of his eyes ,and I felt so proud, I said to myself, ""I want to feel like i'm on top of the world, I want something big for me.""

Many students may say that they don't care about college which is somewhat understandable. I was with a friend one day and I was telling her about how I want to go to college so bad, but she didnt seem to care. She looked me in the eyes and said, ""What's the point of college anyways, its just like going back to hell. My parents never went and there fine."" They also say that going to college is the worst thing ever. My friend once said, ""Why do schools even give the opportunity to students to figure out where they want to go, we don't need college and we dont need a future either. I Actually like working at Wendy's."" After my friends said those nasty things about college it just made me want to work harder in life and get better grades in school.

In conclusion, exploring certain occupations through internships is not that bad of an idea, its a brilliant idea. As i once said, I'm most likely to know what i want in the future, and I will get a good job that pays well. My cousins really have inspired me, because of them and their story, I want to be better and I want to work harder. Maybe later in life I will be working for the government and I will make my future kids happy.",4.0,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,3.751119,3.7411525,3.8980994,3.838757,3.7876558,3.671239,3.5546882,3.55925,3.6419008,3.5698676,3.2292538,3.356,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,705,35,0.3673758865248226,20.142857142857142,9,7,"{'occupations', 'internships', 'upcoming', 'prouder', 'bravest', '2015', 'anyways'}"
23958A3106EA,"The work in group will always have an excellent results. I feel working in group have several benefits than working alone. When we hear that we are going to work alone it sounds good but not for all. It should be great for those people who don't have the capacity to work with others. Even you do not believe it, working in group is feature that no all humans have it. Why I think like that? because working with other people we help us to learn different types of job, we can able to work in others areas with others folks, we can meet amazing people.

To begin with, working in group can help us to learn different types of job. I have my own experience with this. When I started my first job I didn't learn enough. I worked in a hotel and people there liked to work alone. Sometimes I didn't know how to do something and I immediately asked but those workers didn't like to teach others, and they said you should learn by yourself. Obviosly I didn't agree with them and I started to find different job where I could learn more. Working alone was the most diffucult job I've ever had. I could't learn from others because they didn't give me the opportunity to do it. Now I got experience from others how to work in restaurant, markets or shopping centers. I think you will learn hundred percentage better if you are learning from others. However, some people claim that work alone is more beneficial to concentrate, but I insist that work with someone else with leave you more knowledge than work alone.

To continue, if we worked before in commuties or in group we are able to work in different areas of work and also work with different folks, it will be easier for us. When we are looking for a job in our interview the boss or managers will always ask if we have problem to work with others. They ask this questions because they want to be sure that we will work in different places and we will interact with the other employees. If we anwser NO, I'm really sure that we won't get job soon. If we are willing to learn and work together as a team we'll have success in every job that we get. If we change of jobs is because we are looking for something better, and we will achieve working in different areas learning diffrente jobs, acquiring experience from others, showing that we are able to work with others, all these can be beneficial for us when we are looking for job.

In addition, we can meet amazing people working in group. When we work with others we are making friends. My mom found her best friend Generic_Name in her job. They have eleven years with this beutiful friendship. Everyone needs a friend that can help, teach and learn with you. Think about it, there are more benefits working with someone else than working alone. Even though some people say that working in group is more complicated because you will find people who don't want to teach how to work or it can be distracting for you. I feel sure that there are more people good than bad and also if you know your work, you know what to do in your job there aren't people or thing distracting for job. We should be responsable with our job this is an important thing that you shouldn't forget. In schools, in works or in the street we'll find amazing people who will help to improve our skill as workers or as humans being.

To sum up, working in group will help us to find better jobs, to learn new thing, to interact with different people. Here in The United States we will find many jobs, we are able to learn many thing and also to interact with different people from different countries. Do not reject the opportunities to grow and accomplish your dreams.

B4B2CB4AA07F,"The School Board plans to add one and a half hours to school each day. Is that a good or bad idea?

I disagree with that because, many students have other activities after school. It could also affect the teachers by them staying after longer and kids would just have to take in a lot of new material including homework and its not healthy for them.

I feel like when they add extra school hours to the day it would mess the students schedule up, they could have sports after school or tutoring. They could really enjoy their activities and for them not to be able to do any of that anymore does not seem fair.""I have soccer practice every day after school and I love it and it would be a shame if i had to give it up because of more school.""The parents would also have to change their schedule because they could be at work and then have to leave to pick up their children, they would also not have as much time hanging out with friends or family because school would be their main focus when they could be outside being kids. However students enjoy seeing their friends at school and saying ""hello or hi"" we need more time to communicate as well so our friendships don't fade.

Teachers as well would have to work longer shifts, and they already stay after grading students papers while they also have to find out what the next lesson is going to be the next day. They take time out of their day to help the students who are falling behind in the subject and need a little more help to make sure they succeed in school and in their future. Teachers also have families just like every other person in the world, which means they should be able to go home at a good time and help their children out with their work or be able to cook dinner and take time out to care for their kids. Teachers need breaks as well they work very hard to maintain the material we need to understand. They leave the school late like 5-6 and when they leave they look exhausted just imagine them leaving at 7-8 including the fact that they sometimes would stay after helping students and that makes the student tired. We need to give teachers some credit and not push the limits for them as well.

Students stay at school for eight hours each day and if you extend it to nine and a half hours that does not seem like a good amount for students. If they get a lot of work on top of their homework that could stress them out, and because of that their grades could go down because of to much work. We only get three months from school and some shorts breaks and then we have nine months of school, and then you add another hour then what is the point of a break when you just make the school days longer. Kids love going outside and doing there hobbies they can't just sit in a chair all day that also just makes them more irritated. Students also have test's and quizzes including homework each week. If you add more hours kids are probably going to fall asleep and not pay attention which would lead to not participating, students would not have a good attitude either because they would be grumpy and upset that the school day is longer. Our brain can only take so much and they would over due it which is not good for our health. We sleep 9-12 hours a day and have another eight hours at school and then we come home and do more school work and study which leads us pretty much with two hours of they day for us to eat and get ready for bed, just so we can do it over again the next day.

As a student I feel like that would be to much. We are people not robots we need to live not be stuck in a building all day long. We have family and friends that we want to spend time with and that won't be able to happen if they change it because,"" they think we need longer days."" Yes we need our education and we will get it, but for now we only live once so need to make it count and focus on the present.",4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.79513,3.6838903,3.8950665,3.875338,3.7715557,3.6968412,3.701265,3.8597357,3.9806614,4.1448464,4.3548822,3.7651942,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,758,27,0.3482849604221636,28.074074074074076,6,10,"{'robots', 'hobbies', 'soccer', 'tutoring', 'grumpy', 'grading', 'quizzes', 'wo', 'homework', 'fade'}"
4CFAF19AF547,"Technology has it ups and downs with some being useful to use humans and some being harmful and destructive. Has technology come to a point where we need to use it in our everyday life or has it become where we don't even need it because we're to lazy to do thing ourselves. I think that limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has had many negative effect on people's lives because it can cause depression or isolation, can cause some people to lose their touch of reality, and can harm your physical or mental health. Likewise, technology can cause many harmful things.

In other words, technology can cause depression or isolation can really be very bad situation especially if you have both. Depression can be caused by technology because many kids around the world get bullied through social media ,and some get very emotionally depressed. That's when kids want to isolate themselves and don't go to school. Many people around the world like playing video games, and some are very into it that they don't even know that they are isolating themselves from everyone around them. Most people around the world have a phone, a cellular device, and use it all day and don't even come out once. Technology can cause a big impact on people's life and causes them to have depression.

Consequently, technology can also make people lose their touch with reality. Some people can easily manipulate other through the internet. At a young age kid like to TV, YouTube video ,and things like that, and many kids if not all are very gullible. Many videos on YouTube can make kids believed something thats is not true or even brainwash them. Adults also can get brain washed through the Internet. Many conspiracy theories say that the government are trying to brainwash people with technological advancement machine and many to believe that it's not true. Some people even get brainwashed by playing so many video game at a young age, and believe what they do in a games is what they can in real life.

Additionally, as technology keeps on progressing it's just going to keep on getting worse for our physical and/or mental health. Eye doctors say that if your always on a device and it will effect your vision. Technology can mental change you as a person because some people want to be like someone on the internet and change the way they dress and even in some situations their personality. In some cases people have watch many videos of people doing very dangerous stunt. Some people actually try and attempt the same stunt they saw on the video and fail miserably and end up going to the hospital.

In the other hand, technology can come and be useful. It can also safe peoples lives in a situation where someones life is at risk. Technology can also come in handy for us to win wars. It's usefulness can make someones life way more efficient. Technology just overall makes like so much simple and easy. People don't even have to stress about thing as much as they used to anymore because of technology. Technological advancement can change the world as we know it. However, technology can malfunction anytime or anywhere. Technology advancement machine can be the cause of someones death. People might think that technology is going to make life easier, but it's only gong to get harder. If people just let technological advancement machine do everything for them their physical health is just going to plummet down because people are not getting the exercise they need. Also people need to understand technology is getting in the way of something beautiful, the Earth. Technology is causing pollution around the world and killing our home.

Overall, technology is causing all these horrific things to use and we don't even know it until we look around use. I personally think that limitation of human contact to the use of technology can have a negative outcome on people's lives because can cause people to lose they're touch with the outside world, can cause depression or isolation, and can a severe effect and people's physical or mental health. So, technology can be ignored but it will never go away.",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.8179677,3.7125447,3.9107676,3.8231049,3.5900404,3.7183585,3.29901,3.659444,3.8736904,3.5478864,3.2296696,3.6584811,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,728,38,0.3667582417582417,19.157894736842103,7,18,"{'brainwash', 'bullied', 'miserably', 'someones', 'gullible', 'cellular', 'progressing', 'stunt', 'ups', 'gong', 'plummet', 'video', 'brainwashed', 'horrific', 'malfunction', 'internet', 'anytime', 'videos'}"
B6B85CE5C8F5,"When it comes to trying to be someone, is it better to improvise or follow the script all the time?

Everyone needs to have their own individuality and be original instead of trying to be something else because that way you learn more about yourself. Also, you are acknowledging different methods about how to be better than yourself. And one of the most important things, you could make a good influence in someone else's life and teach him/her how to find their path in their own way. No matter what happens, you always have to follow yourself.

When you learn more about yourself it means that you do not just learn things that you already know about yourself, you also learn new things that you did not know about yourself. For example, one day you are going to the basement of your house which is really big and put some good music. While you are listening to your favorite songs from your playlist, you are dancing according to the tempo and doing the dancing moves that you usually do. After dancing for a long while, suddenly you let the music take control over you and you make a back flip without practicing it before. You are very surprised because you did something that you did not know you could do and after that, you keep practicing that move and perfectioning it and it comes out natural. That is how you learn more about yourself.

You are acknowledging different methods to be better than yourself. This means you will do whatever is right in order to become a better person. For example, Robert Downey Jr used to have a terrible life by consuming drugs and other things that got him in trouble with the law. He even went to court for all the messy things he did. After a long time taking bad decisions, he finally decided to make things better for the people who cares about him and specially for him. It took him over 5 years for him to get back on his feet; with his own effort and the support from his family and friends, he started to make a good difference for the world. Right now, Robert is one the best actors in Hollywood, he has an excellent life with his wife and kids on his side, and is a great influence for millions of people. That is how you acknowledge different methods to be better that yourself.

Some people say that you are copying someone else when you try to be yourself. However, they are wrong because you actually are listening to those tips that you have heard and following them under your own perspective. That way you are definitely writing your own script but at the same time, giving the deserved credit to the person who gave you those tips. For instance, when you are trying to get a girl that you met in a party but you have no idea of what to do in order to get her attention. You ask your friend for some advice to accomplish your goal so you do not go through a bad experience. He tells you what to do exactly and shows you with some women at the party and now you have some ideas of what you can do. So before you reach out to that girl, your friend tells you ""be yourself all the time"" and you get the courage to talk to her. After following those examples in your own way, the girl started to have deep feelings for you and everything worked out a lot well and make some influence to some of your friends who need that kind of help. That is how you follow your own script with your own terms.

In conclusion, it is very important that you have be yourself all the time because it shows that you do not need somebody in order to be somebody. You learn about yourself so you can get to know your own person more than you can know about an anime character. You acknowledge new ways to become better than yourself like if you were in a videogame, you are going to the next level slowly. You make a good influence by doing things as right as possible and you give people some benefits out of it. To be yourself you have to do what your gut tells you to do if you think it is going to give some benefits in some way.",3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.9492812,3.8992383,4.0997634,3.999434,3.9184394,4.001235,3.8934412,3.4129725,3.5419075,3.2757382,3.2267337,3.5396187,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,753,33,0.3598937583001328,22.818181818181817,9,7,"{'5', 'improvise', 'anime', 'messy', 'acknowledging', 'copying', 'gut'}"
B9B71CEE162B,"This is a very important important subject to me Thank You fore giving me the opportunity write about it. In my opinion i believe that graduating in four years is a lot better than, graduating in three years. The traditional four years of high school does not put the student under pressure, unlike the three year plan. The four year plan allows the student to have some elective classes. The three year plan helps students graduate faster but it also, it does not give people time to enjoy the summer or have free time to do their favorite hobby.

High school is the best time of every student's life, because in high school students do not have a lot of responsibilities. Students who decide to pick the three year plan will be making a big mistake. Students might not be able to have any elective classes, these classes are made to be easy classes that help student do their favorite hobby like playing guitar, piano and sports, these type of classes help students remove the stress from their brains by doing something they like. I am pretty sure that students who do the four year traditional plan will be doing better in school because they are not pressured, unlike the other students with the three year plan. I was born in Egypt i moved to the United States in 2015, which was my freshman year of high school. I had to take all the mandatory classes in my first year in order to be able to graduate on time. I was not able to take any elective classes, which put me under pressure and made feel bad, because of the amount of homework and the number of hours i used to sit in my room and study.

Students in high school should be enjoying their lives. Students who do the three year plan do not have time to enjoy their lives with their family all year long, because they will have to study in order to pass their class and graduate. We all know that social life is important to every single one of us and, it affects how we do in school. Students who do the three year plan do not have time to do anything but study and do school related stuff which causes a lot of people depression and anxiety. Last year one of my closest friends had to do summer school, every time i call him he barley answers and says that he can not hang out because he got school related work to do. My friend used to hangout with me all the time but he did not because he had to go to summer school, he was telling me that he was not happy be cause he would wake up go to school finish school, go straight to work, come back from work do his homework and sleep, he barley had time to eat, which made him very tired mentally and physically.

Some of the students in high school are independent, they live on their own have a job and dont ask parents for money. Independent students can not do the three year plan because the will not have any time to do anything other than work and school. For example i have a job i live on my own and i do not as my parents for any money or anything in order for me to do the three year plan i will have to quit my job, so i can be able to focus on school or else i will fail in school and not be able to graduate and if quit my job i will have no source of income to take care of myself and pay for my rent, but i do the four year traditional plan and i have a good job where i can focus on both school and my job so i can live.

In conclusion the three year plan is not a very good decision to make and everyone should think twice before deciding on it. The three year plan does not let students have their free time to hand out with their friends or do their favorite hobby. That plan also does not give people time to have time with their family or the people they love. The three year plan will not give you time to have a job if you need one. I believe by going to high school for four years students will be able to get more experience and enjoy the best time of their lives.

DD265EC28AEB,"Now a days schools are finding new ways to use cell phones for educational purposes. Schools and teachers want to find new ways to educate students through cell phones since every child is attracted to them. But with schools trying to find ways that works, it does have its negative effects to it. The effects with using cell phones in classroom for educational purposes is that many students will end up getting off tasks, no more hands on learning, and they will start to relying too much on their cell phones. With cell phones being use for educational purpose, it has its negative effects to it and will affect student's learning in the process.

As cell phones are being use for educational purposes, a negative effect to this idea is that students will not focus or get off task in their classes. If they use cell phones in classroom for a method to educate people, students with tend to get distracted on their phones and not learn what they are suppose to teach. Students will also end up dozing off and start to listen to music or even end up playing games on their phones and not focus on what's being taught. Also with social media being so big now a days students will focus more on texting friends or being on their Snapchat, Instagram, or even Twitter rather than focusing on what teacher is showing the classroom. With cell phones being use in classroom, students will end up getting more distracted and off task than when you do not use cell phones in the classroom to teach. The next paragraph will talk about another reason why using cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes has its negative effect.

As cell phones are being use for educational purposes, a negative effect to this idea is that there is no more hands on learning for students. If school are using cell phones as a method to teach people, the students are not getting the hands on learning that they should get. Back then before everyone had a cell phone the way they were taught was with the step by step on doing the work and trying to understand how you ended up doing the work. But if they use cell phones in the classrooms the students would not be getting the step by step understanding of the work, rather than they doing it on the phones and just getting the answers. With schools using phones in the classroom the students would not be getting the same knowledge and understanding to specific problems and work than those who learn the step by step learning to the problems. In the next paragraph we will see another reason why using cell phones for educational purposes has a negative effect in the classrooms.

As cell phones are being use for educational purposes, a negative effect to this idea is that students will end up relying too much on their cell phones and technology to get the work done. As the more classroom or schools end up using cell phones for educational purposes the students will end up relying on their phone to get the work done for them and not try to do it theresleves. For example imagine students cell phones end up not working and they only used their cell phones to get the work done, what are they going to do now if they only use their phone to do the work and they did not learn the material on their own. With schools using phones as a way of teaching it with effect the students ways of learning and will start to rely on his/her phone in the later future to get their stuff done. In the last paragraph it will concluded the paper and sum up everything about the paper.

In conclusion if more and more schools end up using cell phones for educational purposes they will make more students get distracted during class, not have the hands on learning they should have, and also they will start to rely on their cell phones more for the work rather than them trying to do the work them self. With cell phones trying to be used as a method of learning, it will end up not giving the students the education they need but rather them showing a way to get the work done quicker without all the extra work that should be done. So schools should stick with the methods they have now and not try to add cell phones as another method of teaching these students.

I was in walmart one day, than I saw a man with small legs and Generic_Name started make fun of how the man walked, talked, and the man heard him he asked Generic_Name if he wanted to do a biking raise with him, Generic_Name said yes, they did the raise and the man with small legs own. After that Generic_Name never made fun of anyone he saw. A problem is a chance for you to do your best because it can change your life and it can teach you.

First of all, a problem can change your life. Oneday

I was at walmert and Generic_Name was telling his story of the past. He said, I used to steal, tell lies, I didn't listen to anyone and I also didn't work. One day, we went on a family vacation, on our way back we got hit by a truck and

I was the only one who surived in that accident. After that, I wanted to take my life, for I didn't see the reason of living anymore. Six months passed, and nothing was working in my life. Then oneday I went to the beach planing to take my own life he said, when I started walking toward the water I saw a man sitting in the sand. He asked me, who are , my name is Generic_Name

I said, and I started telling the man my story. Then the man said, your life matters the reason why you survived the accident that night is because it wasn't your time yet, your life matters because you are still breathing said the man, that is a gift because there are people out there wishing they don't have machines helping them to breath. These words changed my life, he said, I didn't forget about my family but I fixed my life for the good. This evidence shows that Generic_Name used to steal, tell lies, didn't work and didn't listen to anyone, his family got into a care accident and he was the only one that surived, he wanted to take his own life but all that changed when he met a man at the beach who opened his eyes. clearly, a problem is something that can take your life to the next level.

In addition, a problem can teach you. There was this man named Generic_Name, he was a faithful man he helped people in need with what he had, Generic_Name had eleven children, five boys and six girls. All his children were trained to help people in need. One day, something happened, a messanger came to Generic_Name and told him that his house was set one fire, and his children were in there. Everything that Generic_Name owned was destroyed, Generic_Name, who was Generic_Name's wife, was not pleased with what happened. Generic_Name's friends told him to repent maybe he did something bad to his God, but he said he didn't sin against anyone, his wife told him to curse God and he will die , but Generic_Name didn't. Oneday Generic_Name got really mad that he shouted at God and when he did that he remembered years ago, Generic_Name promised to give a family some food and kept saying I will give you some food I promised, but Generic_Name will always forget. The whole family died because of Generic_Name. When he remembered this Generic_Name asked forgiveness to God, and he forgave Generic_Name. Everything he had was restored. This evidence shows that Generic_Name lost everything he had, but at last he remmbered his mistake and asked for forgiveness. Clearly, we can learn from our problems. Inconclusion, a problem can be a chance for you to do your best because it can change your life and it can teacher to you. If you ever found yourself in a sitaution like Generic_Name's remember your life matters and don't forget the promises you give to people because it can destroy your life.

D7EC70BFCAB6,"Allowing cell phones in classrooms it can be a benefit for some students and a disadvantage for others. Although some say that cell phones should be allowed in classrooms because they believe that using cell phones in the classroom it can help students to research for a project or it can help to do any other assignment . Actually it shouldn't because students can cheat during a test and they get distracted.

Some say that cell phones shouldn't be allowed in classrooms because students can cheat during a test and they get distracted. For example one day my English teacher told me that she let her students to use their phone during a test to search something about the meaning of the words that they doesn't know. Then, she told me that she told them that they can only use their phones to translated the words that they doesn't know what it means or to translated to their own language. After that she says that she gave to her students the test and she went to seat to her desk, but then she was observing that one of her students was using his phone too frequently, she went to see what the student was searching and she saw that the student was searching for the answers of the questions that the test have. After that, she saw that one of the others students was taking pictures of the exam, she went to see why the student was taking pictures of the exam, she ask him that why he was taking pictures of the exam and he told her that he was sending the answers to his friend who was sitting in the back seat.

Moreover, she told me that the other day that she was explaining the class, some students were using their phone and paying less attention to the class. Also, she says that the students who were using their phones during the class when they got the test they doesn't know what to answer because they were distracted with their phones and they got a lower score in the exam. I believe that cell phones shouldn't be allowed in classroom because is a distraction for students, sometimes there are students that when the teacher is explaining the class they are using their phones and when the teacher gave them a test they got bad score in their test and that can be a problem because their grades can get very lower.

Those who believe that cell phones should be allowed in classrooms have their reasons, they believe that using cell phones in the classroom it can help students to research for a project or it can help to do any other assignment. One example can be my friend Generic_Name, his history teacher always gave him assignments that he have to search in the book about the Civil War or World War II. He told me that it's very complicated for him to search some things about those tittles in the book because the books doesn't have enough details for him to what to put in his assignment or sometimes he doesn't know how to summarize the meaning of the paragraphs that the book have. However, when the teacher let him use his phone he began to search about the tittles that he have to search and he says that it's more easy for him to understand more about those tittles because he is using his phone for a educational purpose. Also, he says that when he plays Kahoot or Quizlet live (

those are learning games that sometimes the teachers use to help students to study

) he learn more than when he read a book. In my point of view I believe that cell phones should be allowed in school because for me sometimes is very complicated to read a book because there are some words that I don't understand, but when I use my phone to search it's more easy because in the phone there are some meanings that I understand .

In summary, some say that cell phones shouldn't be allowed in classroom because students can cheat during a test and they get distracted. However, some believe that cell phone should be allowed in classrooms because it can help students to research for as project and to do any other assignment. In my opinion I believe that cell phones should be allowed in school because it easy for me to search the meaning of a word that I don't know and I feel that I learn more then treading a book.

EB03C897F7E8,"Student and teachers are have opposing views on working together for various reasons. However, according to new Stanford research, when people are treated as partners working together their motivation, student are able to communicate with each other, therefore creating a better final product. Working in team also prepares students for future careers and job. Whoever they will be required to learn to cope with other people and personalities, it is valued by employers. Even though students are not agree with each other all the time, working together is ore beneficial than working alone.

Every body ha heard someone in their life say "" two minds are better than one"" before right, this quote has never range more, and all of the idea it promotes reflect crystal clear off of group work. Working in a group can be drastically reduce the amount of work you need to do as well as make thing of more efferent, whether it be a group project paperer presentation. Because it cuts down on how much work one person has to do. It allows for group to achieve more as alone. Things are also finished much quicker because of the way many people can split up different jobs in a group an people with different skill sets can do what they are best at and do not have to worry about what they are bad at, this broader range of skill can also be used to help other people members develop their own by learning from their team members. The diversity found within a group of people is one of most powerful resources a person can have when it comes to finishing a task.

it lends a group of people to have many more ideas to come up with and bounce off of because many people are working

""The best way to have good idea is to have a lot of the a quote from Linus Pauting dealing with dilemma new idea's. When dealing with abdicating an idea from thin air, it be best to have multiple people instant of one because it brings multiple ideas all have fair and different point rather than multiple ideas no opposition or diversity.

Another benefit of having multiple people working in one group is that this can cause an evolutionary like phenomenon with multiple, stronger idea that complete and mulute, creating one in tribute and exceptional idea. This also comes with the help of a group, as a group can decide which idea would be main idea and smoothe out the edyes.

Another problem that can come up is well problem. Having a group of people can become extremely helpful for solving a problem that may come up in situations where a problem can arise, having a group of people can allow for quick and easy way to get out of a situation. Now working in a group does not have its advantage but some things are best done alone

Though working in a group can seem to be good working alone can be better depending on the situation. Being in group full of adult and unfocused group members is infuriating and may seem like torture. Although, some people prefer working alone because they can focus better and make decision faster, in the end, it is a better to working in a group.

if one does not do work the only they fail. Also being in a group fell safe. While being alone means you are much more impotent so working in group

Though working alone can be better for one reason such as anxiety. paranoia worry about other preference, or simply because they would prefer to work alone. Working in a team is advantage over some others who are unaccustomed to doing so , it helps develop people skill decision making skills and general expertise for putting up with others.

working in a group is also good for getting other people's opinion on group member work, as long as they do their part, oftentimes students will learn and experience more in a group of their peers than working alone which is definitely better for their future an possibly what lies ahead. Developing these skill will most likely help in the coming times of college, careers their future family and even retirement.

05F30981F3EB,"Imagine if online schooling was offered at every school. Schools are offering online classes for students to attend class. Also schools offer video conferencing online to help benefit at home. This is important because some students are not responsible to get to school on time. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because health issues play a major role through out the school year, students can become smarter by taking time to learn the content, students would not have to stress over transportation.

Certainly some might think staying in the house all day causes bordom to do school work. Others believe students tend to need help from an adult to understand that content. Still others argue by feeling alone will not motivate them to be productive.

To begin with, health issues play a major role through out the school year on students. Students always tend to come to school while they are sick. So that spead germs through out the school and causes major illness. Spreading germs can have someone hospitalized and in bad condition. Which can make students have bad attendince. Also parents would loose jobs to attend to their sick child. However staying home and still be able to do your school work causes less stress. Because it gives student more time to be able to complete there assignments. Another reason way online classes will help out students that are in wheel chairs, crutches, and broken legs. Is they dont have to be rushed, pushed, in the crowded halls. Therefore they feel more safe and have enough space at home. Parents will be able to supervise their child more. An not be worried that something else might happen. Health issues should be a cause of not being able to not attend school if you are able to do it from home.

Secondly students become smarter doing the research on their own to retain the information. Every student have a diffent way to learn. Some students need day's to understand the content. An some can understand the content off the first try. Also some student need to see it hands on then be supervised as they complete the task. Witch is also not a bad way to retain information. If help is needed the video conferencing will help out in the long run. Being able to home relax and still manage to completed your school work motivates the student to remain on task. Another reason why is grades will have a major increase and students would maintain a higher grade point average. The best part of the video conferencing is the student will be able to replay it if needed. Instead of hearig it once in class from a teacher then forgetting the information the next time you have that subject. Apart of life that is important to have is knowledge, so being able to teach and perfect your weakness are important.

Lastly transportation is a mojor problem for students. Some students have to walk, get droped off, or take the bus to get to school on time. Most students are not responsible to wake up on time to catch the bus. The students that walk are stessed, because they have to walk while its raining, hot, ride their bike, cold, and dark. In conditions like that are not safe for students to go through is something happend to them. Most of the time parents have to work and be worried that their child get to school safe. Having the privaledge to be home and do work will prevent fights, childish students, and angery teachers. So everyone would have peace and respect for one another and learn more. There will be no disagreement and aultications with students and teachers. After school students will not have to rely on transperations, because they are already home. Less stress can be taken off of adukts that are nor responsible for you. Having to find transpertation to your destination is worth money and not everyone is forchen to loan out money all the time.

Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because health issues play a major role through out the school year, students can become smarter by taking time to learn the content, and students would not have to stress over transportation. If students was able to stay home and do school work the it would be less confusion in school. Keep calm and remain focus even if times get hard on your shoulders.

F8A3497B5F2D,"Many schools allow their students to visit different types of companies so they could explore many interested jobs,for example schools and companies get in a deal to help students to get knowledge for their future and also companies allow students to be able to visit and get information in their occupations,I know as a fact that students can be professionals in what they want with good knowledge,as a example my whole family went through all of that and know they have become lawyers,doctors,and one of them works for the president. If managers give students the opportunity to visit their occupations,students who work hard won't lose that excellent opportunity,and managers would have an amazing great roll in students achievement which I know it would help the company. Although some say that companies should not give me the opportunity to explore and visit their occupations because if the company that I went to visit doesn't have that much of of opportunities for me to discover,whether I'm interested in what they have,and I may be disappointed ,and probably I would have in mind to talk bad about the company that they don't have sufficient knowledge or information,actually companies should give me the opportunity to explore and visit their occupations because I would have a great experience of the excellent opportunities that they may have,and I as a student I will have the experience to explore and get some knowledge at a young age of the opportunities that I can be able to get if I prepare to have a amazing future.

Some say that companies should not give me the opportunity to explore and visit their occupations because if the company that I went to visit doesn't have that much of of opportunities for me to discover,whether I'm interested in what they have,and I may be disappointed ,and probably I would have in mind to talk bad about the company that they don't have sufficient knowledge or information,for example,my older brother had the opportunity to visit an important company called ""Dream Big""he expect that in that company they would have information about what he was interest,but sadly it didn't went that well,my brother was sad and angry at the same time,so he made a fake account to talk about the company ,as a result the company decrease in a 20% of people that were involved.

Companies should give me the opportunity to explore and visit their occupations because I would have a great experience of the excellent opportunities that they may have,for example,my mother always tells me a story about how she became a lawyer,she said that as a student,she was preparing herself for the future,thanks to school,they gave her a chance to explore and get some knowledge about lawyers in a company called ""Everything is possible,if you believe it""she had the chance as a lawyer to meet the president,also there is a story about her in the internet,she became a lawyer because she had the opportunity.

I as a student I will have the experience to explore and get some knowledge at a young age of the opportunities that I can be able to get if I prepare to have a amazing future for example,I read about an incredible woman who know is a professional chemistry teacher ,in the story gave details about how she became who she is it doesn't specific which company she went to learn about her career,but the point is that she has an excellent job,because she got prepare for it.

Although some say that companies should not give me the opportunity to explore and visit their occupations because if the company that I went to visit doesn't have that much of of opportunities for me to discover,whether I'm interested in what they have,and I may be disappointed ,and probably I would have in mind to talk bad about the company that they don't have sufficient knowledge or information,actually companies should give me the opportunity to explore and visit their occupations because I would have a great experience of the excellent opportunities that they may have,and I as a student I will have the experience to explore and get some knowledge at a young age of the opportunities that I can be able to get if I prepare to have a amazing future.

3F20E4B1AA0D,"Should students have longers breaks during the school years? i have lestening to all the parents at school saying that students should get more longers breaks during the school year but i am totally desagree because, it is not a good idea having really longers breaks during the entire school year .Some students dont have the ability to learn easily than the others and if we get more longers breaks then we will not have time to teach those students who really needs help in school and it is not that the school is like trying to be mean to the students it is just that we think that if we give more education to the students then they will have a better future in their lifes.

First of all we all know that having breaks sounds reallly fun but sometimes we need to think about our future, in specific when we want to live a good life or have a better future and i think having breaks all the time it is not that necessary. For example, if someone is going to vacations, breaks and traveling around the world all the time, they probably dont know that is going on in the present or what are the news of the day , they are not being educate but in this case we are talking about the students so i think if students have really logers breaks all the time they are not going to be educate when they grow up , they are not going to do things by them self because they are not going to know how to do something .

second of all, giving breaks to the students all the time its is not good because, they are not going to have a good behavior in their future, some teachers works really hard to teach those students who dosen't have the ability to learn like others and when they going to vacations or breaks , all the hard work that the teachers were giving to the students will be gone because, they will not been focusing in school or they will not being focusing in what they were learning about. Also when students go to vacations or breaks they only think about having a great time with friends or family and i know that their are some others kids or students that sometimes are not like those students who dont really care about their future and i honestly think that if all the students could be educate individually will be a really good idea .

Finally, i think that the parents really need to know how important is to being educate when u are young because , when a person stars growing up everything in your mind change too. As adult i can say that it is hard to learn things when u get older. Sometimes when you get old, you star getting more lazy but when you are young it gets easy because , the only thing you have to do is study and focusing on school so that is why i think being educate is really important for a human and it is not good to be wasting time in longers breaks or vacations when we can waste all that time doing proyects, homework and activitides in school, and if the students have longers breaks then they will forget the knowledge during the breaks .

As a result , i think having longers breaks it not that really necessery for students specially when they are young because, a student dont really need that much time to relaxing or that much time to have a free time doing nothing . Also i can say that a student dont need a really a long break because, when i was in high school the only thing that i needed to be focusing on was in school becuse i wanted to have education, i wanted to have a better life and be a good person in the future. I also think that when you are educate you have more opportunity to get a job. For example , if you are not educate and you want to apply to get a job, the manager it is going to see that you are not educate enough to be working in the place ,so you absolully not going to have a chance to get a job. And i think that is really important for getting a job in whatever place you want to work in, so i really think that the students should not have longers breaks during the school year , that way students will be more polite in school and they will be focussing in learning more things that is going to take them to a better place ,to a better life and to a better future.",2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0496755,2.882334,3.1929736,3.0182648,2.8219175,2.8055856,2.8421285,2.8145492,3.4474056,2.9949622,2.8518853,3.1327362,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.5,797,14,0.2685069008782936,56.92857142857143,13,2,"{'homework', 'focussing'}"
81218F777A2F,"Energy should be conserve more because alot of people do not use alot of these particular items half of the time. It is better to save energy rather than waste. Like for eample, we use light everyday to see things around us so that we do not trip or bump into things. If not we wouldnt be able to see things near us. At times we take advantage way too much. Were wasting alot of light source that we hardly ever use at times. Therefor, were wasting alot of energy that we should not be wasting. Alot of people tend to go out to places to run some errands and leave there lights on for no reason or just keep the light on for no particular reason. The best way to save energy would be to turn off the light before you go out and not just leave it on because your just making your bills go up. When you do not even use it half of the time. It would help alot and keep you from wasting alot of money.

Second reason, would be us not recyling things that we drink or eat. We tend to just throw it in the trash instead of the recyling bin. Even in schools they have recyling bins but us people do not pay attention to it because it is nowhere to be seen. It would be better if the recycling bin was to be seen. I feel like people would use it and recycle more. Also will save resources that can be cleaned and used again. Rather than just using more products to make the particular object. Schools and other places should make an improvement and stop using alotof energy and resources and make it easier for the resources that are being used. Us people should recycle more and save light source and actually help the world be a better place and keep it clean and simple. If we were able to do that it would make everything else easier.

Overall, schools should not be extending it for two more hours. Reasons why is because teachers tend to use alot of paper to give students to work on. Most of the times teachers would not use front and back of the paper. They would always do work on seprate pices of papers and give them to the students. To make things easier for them would be to use front and back because there not using alot of paper. So that it can be graded on and be thrown out by the students. Students never like to keep paper with them when teachers grade them after. So alot of paper is going to waste for no reason. Teachers should consider of teaching students with technology and doing work on there rather then using alot of paper. Technology would help because trees would not be going to waste and harm the things around there surrounding just to make paper out of it. Alot of trees would be save and have alot of resources still. People should just think about the goods thing and the bad things about it. Like is it worth wasting all these resources rather than using technology.

There is advantages and disadvantages of extending school for two hours. The advantage would be students being able to learn more and have more time spent with their peers and teachers. Students would have more time to do work rather than doing it at home and struggling. It is better for them not to waste time and get the help they need. But, at the same time the teacher is giving them work which is bad in the way but good also . The work that is being given to them is not bad but the resources that makes is because of how it is made. Eventually, schools should just use technology and do all the work there. Students would be able to access it easier and teachers would not have to worry about the students losing work or having problems. Students would also be more entertain because all they like to do or be on is technology and it would help the teachers alot.

Overall this point, teachers or not just them should consider of managing the time they use on things that use alot of energy. It would make the world a better place and more healthier. Trees would not have to be cut down alot and affecting their surroundings. Basically would not cause pollution in the air and hurt things around it like for example animals . It is important to save energy an keep the world safe. Schools should just do everthing on computers and make things easier.

63AB55DADABF,"Do you think we should extend our school day? No, I think we shouldn't extend the time because we already get enough learning and our classes are long. I also don't think we should extend the time because we will be getting out of school later. If we we extend the time then we could be very exhausted during the school day. This could also be very difficult for the bus drivers because they will be getting home extremely late and it will be dark when they are driving the kids home back from school.

We get enough time in school already so there is no need to add more time the the school day. We learn enough in every class, and we learn everthing that we need to learn in that hour and a half. We learn what we have to learn and if we add time the the teachers won't really know what to do. I think we understand that they are saying and we understand the concept they are teaching us. The school day would be way longer for elementrary kids. I don't think its fair for elementray because they stay in their classes the entire day . It would be very broring because they are going to be sitting there for eight and a half hour. It would be very broing for them, because they don't get to switch classes like middle and highschool. They should also have some fun during the school day they shouldn't just sit there and high school and middle school at least get to move around while they are switching classes. They really can't do anything after school is done.

If we extend the time in school we will be at school later. Kids will be tired the next day because they wont get home until the evening. They wont pay attention to class because they didn't get enough sleep and they will not be paying close attention to what the teacher is saying because the class it too long. We will also be getting home late. Elementray kids will be getting home around 5:00pm. They won't be able to do many activities after school because they are getting home late. When they get home they will have to eat, shower, and go to sleep because they have school the next day and they deserve some fun. High school kids wake up around 5:00am and they will be at school for eight hours and then they wiil go home and do their homework. They will be tired because they don't get enough sleep and they have to wake up very early. They also can't do activities because of the homework they have and how early they have to wake up and the time they get out of school. They will get home late and they can't do much because they will have to focus on homework and school.

Extending the time could be harder for bus drivers. Bus drivers need enough sleep so that they can drive the students safely to school. Sleep is the most important and you should get at least eight hours of sleep, and that can't be possible for bus drivers because they will get home late. They all need to rest good so that they can be wide awake. If they don't get enough sleep this could lead to crashes. Crashes could happen if it's too dark and the bus drivers can't see outside. Elementray students would be getting out out around 5:00pm and around that time it will start to get dark and it isn't good for bus drivers, because they cant see if they are somewhere very dark. They also won't get to see their family as much anymore and spend time with them. They need to spend time with their family it is important to spend time with them. If they get home around eight then they will get to spend very little time with them. They have to go to sleep early because they need to wake up on time. Crashes aren't good because the parents can sue the county and that will be the countys fault because it was dark outside and maybe the bus driver couldn't really see outside.

I dissagree with adding one and a half hour to the school day. I think seven hours is enough time for a school day and to learn all the materials that we nned to know. What do you think should we add one and a half hour to our school day?

570595740274,"Do students need summer break or they can handle not have summer but with more breaks around the year?

Students need summer break because students like summer more than other other times in the year because is hot outside and it doesn't snow all the day also, during break some students can do things that they couldn't do because of the school. For example have a job, just enjoy and relax outside with family and friends or have big families plans that they were expected, students have more odds to do all that in summer because.

They can put all their effort in their jobs. almost all the students that I know have summer job in fact I actually have two summer jobs. For students have a summer job is actually very important and it means a lot because it can be the first thing that they actually put all their effort, and is not only the fact that they put all their effort it can be the fact that they can be helping their family for example.

Their mom is having a bad time at work, the sells went down, is being two weeks since the last buyer went to the store, is not something new at the store that could bring buyer, and is being a bad moth for their mom, their son will try to help her paying small things like the internet, the water, the light or he could actually do his best, paying all that and paying the rent of the house, some teenagers not only work in summer for their own good some teenager work for help their family with everything they can however. Sometimes they need relax, doing nothing or going out to eat, watch a movie with friends or family, or go to party with your friends and enjoy summer how I said, I have two summer jobs.

The first one is in construction and the second one is in a place called Generic_Name. My first week doing all that I feel tired and I feel that I couldn't do all that anymore but I realize that my family needed me and I keep doing it, in my first work I actually learn a lot about how to measure things and how to use a electric hammer also my boss is my uncle so I spend good time with him and I meet some really nice people. The second one is in Generic_Name I had to take care of kids, clean the place and make food, I meet really nice people there that helped me a lot and I realize that I like work with kids. However some students don't have a summer job and that is fine, some students likely have some family plans or plan with their friends that they want to do for summer like.

Go some to another country with you parents, sometimes parents have vacations at the same time that summer start if they change the vacations it will interfere with the time that students spend with their parents. Some students actually don't spend a lot time with their parents in fact I am one of those. our parents work to 8 AM to 8 PM and when they come back they are tired and they just wanna eat and go to sleep, and we understand why they are like that. In summer we spend time with out parents we go out to eat, we go to the movies or we go in a travel to another country that is the first reason why student prefer the vacations in summer than in another time of the year the second reason can be.

because of the sun, we all have to accept that we get tired of the cold, rain, snow and frozen rain we all get tired, and we want the sun also with the sun your garden won't die or it wont look ugly. Sometimes when we have summer some times another school from another country or another state have summer that means they could come here or we could go there and spend time with them. I actually have some friends from Venezuela and every time they have summer they come here to spend summer with me however.

Yeah sometimes it can be hard retain information but students need rest for while, spend time with their families and friends, and if they want it or they need it get a job and do their best.

Can they change vacations for another day or just have more different vacations but not that long?

No summer is not only the time where students rest, also is the time when they spend time with their parents or friends, it can be the time for some students to work and help their family.",3.0,2.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.1199014,2.9186325,3.288361,3.0754557,2.8465655,3.0054746,3.1579826,3.0519013,3.484956,2.64768,2.6076279,2.6757722,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,811,22,0.3020961775585696,36.86363636363637,4,10,"{'mom', 'venezuela', 'buyer', 'teenager', 'moth', 'internet', 'wo', 'wan', 'wont', '8'}"
EA970C38817C,"Do you think people accomplish more if they are always doing something or do you think inactivity serve as a purpose?

Thomas Jefferson wrote,""Determine never to be idle...It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.""Many people think that they accomplish more if they are always doing something. When people are always doing something,they are always learning new things and gaining experiences. Some people think that the more they do ,the more they achieve because being idle will not lead you to success and nobody is going to come and accomplish things for you. Therefore much may be done if people are always doing something

Certainly some people think that inactivity serve as a purpose because people can be physically inactive but mentally active and they might be creating wonderful things in their minds. Still others think that being inactive does not mean that they are being idle because they already achieved their dreams and they are satisfied with what they have so that is why they see inactivity as a purpose. Others might think that not everyone have the opportunities to being always doing something and they do not have more option that being inactive.

However, people accomplish more if they are always doing something because they learn new things in the process of doing something. They learn more about themselves and about others. They learn how to interact and connect with others and how to fit in different environments. People who are always doing something gain more and new experiences that will help them later in life also gaining experiences and being in different types of environments surrounded by different kind of people will help them improve their mental maturity and also help them to to have a different perspective of see world and life. In other words people who are always doing something accomplish more,and learn more how to interact with others and gain new experiences.

Furthermore,people accomplish more if they are always doing something because the more you do the more you achieve. If people do not work and make an effort for the things they want to accomplish nobody is going to do it for them because each person is the author of their own success .Some people might be waiting that the things they want fall from the sky ,or appear magically in their hands making no effort to accomplish them and idles will not lead you to success .People who are successful today is because they were always working hard and making their best effort to accomplish their goals,they know what they wanted and they were persistent and did not give up on their goals. If people want to be successful in life they have to know that failure is part of achieving success and just have to keep trying and do not give up until they achieve their goals. Therefore people's success is based on the effort they put to achieve it because the more they do the more they achieve.

In fact, people accomplish more if they are always doing something because they are spending their time in things that really worth it .If people are going to spend time of their life that will never get back they better spend that time doing something that worth it and doing something that is going bring positive ,and good things to their life. Many people spend a lot of time or even their whole life doing things that never brought something positive or good to their life and that is maybe because they never found their passion in life and doing something you are not passionate about it is just a waste of time. Therefore people should spend time following their dreams and doing what they truly love because when they are doing what they are truly passionate about, they will see that every effort they did to accomplish their goal worth the time they spent and the effort they put .As a result when people spend their time always doing something they accomplish more.

In conclusion,people should determine never to be idle and never to conform with what they have. Always work hard and aspire for bigger things ,always try to be successful and do everything and anything to accomplish their dreams, and goals and do not let anyone to tell you that you can not do something because if you believe in yourself you are capable to do everything you want .People should always spend their time in things that worth it, in things that will bring good and positive things to their life .People should be always doing something and that is how they will see what wonderful things can be done by doing always something because the more people do the more they achieve and people who are always doing something are the people who accomplish the more.

293A93F037A7,"I agree with Winston Churchhill because without failure how can we be succesfull in life. Frist, reason why because If you fail at something you can reflect on it. Second, failure can make you become better then you were yesterday if you work hard. Third, Is never let failure consume you. Instead use failure to lead you to success.

You can always reflect on somthing you fail at, and become better. If, you don't study yourself at something you failed at, then you can't become successfull. For example, say you were playing a football game, and you missed your tackle in the game. After the game you watch the film, and see what mistakes you did wrong. After you seen what was wrong in film. You studied the film, and trian harder in practice for next game, so that won't happen again. Another reason you can do after you reflect on yourslef is practicing at something you love to do. For example, riding a bike for the frist time without trianing wheels. If you fail at riding a bike, then you have to practice, so you can become better at it. In order to practice you have to reflect on it frist. After you reflect what you did wrong, then you will become better when you practice.

Failure can teach you to become better then you were yesterday if you work hard. For example, you went to practice for a 100 meter, but you did not wram up at all. You decided to run the 100 meter for the frist time anyway. After you finsh the 100 meter you didn't feel good about the time you had. The next day you decide to warm up, and work harder to get better results. After your trianing you wanted to run a 100 meter. When you ran a 100 meter you felt better with your time, and decided to work harder everyday to become better then you were yesterday. This is how failure is making you better because it is teaching you that if you fail at something, you can always pick it back up, and become better, then what you were doing that day when you failed at something. If you want to become better, then you were yesterday. Then don't worry about the past because thinking about it all the time will bring you back to failure. For example, say you are mad that you lost your 100 meter race in fourth place. When you lost, you keep thinking about it all the time, and can't move forward for the next race. When the next race starts the day after you lost. You lost the race again in fourth place because you keep thinking about the race you lost in the past, then thinking about how can you can become better then you were yesterday. The point is in order to become better you have to think how can you improve better for the future, then thinking about how you failed in the past.

Never let failure consume you. Instead use failure to lead you to success. For example, say you have a math test on Monday, but you decide on Sunday to not study for it because you think the test is very easy. On Monday you give up on a math test, and decide to fail it. The reason why because you did not study, and it was too hard for you. You decide to retake it on tuesday, and learn from your mistakes. On Tuesday after you failed the math test. You took the test again to get a better score because you studied very hard to succesed in the test. This is why you always use failure to lead you to success. If you let failure consume you, then you won't reach to the top to become successful. For example, you can't swim at all, and your drowing. For some reason you dont won't to reach the top because you are depressed, and want to give up.

In conclusion, I still believe It is impossible to be succesfull without failure. Without failure we cannot reach the top to be successful. Without failure we cannot reflect on things to become better. Without failure we cannot become better then yesterday. In order to become successful we have to use failure to lead us to success. Its okay to fail because after you learn from it. Everything is going to be okay when you overcome it, and be better.

3E7DE9C1C160,"What lesson would you chose to teach elementary school students? Would you chose math because they like numbers, or science because they like playing with science experiments. I would chose science, because we use science every day by turning on a light, to throwing a ball up in the air. Another reason many students like science is because it is the most fun, by that I mean by all the experiments we do in science. One lesson I would like to teach elementary school students is about science because it is fun, it is the most easiest subject to teach, and it is the most used in daily life.

Firstly, one lesson I would like to teach is science because it is fun to most adults and kids. First, science is fun because you get to do different types of experiments. For example, If you want to learn about kinetic and potential energy you can use science experiments that have kinetic and potential energy in them. Some experiments can have you involved in throwing a ball so you can illustrate kinetic and potential energy. Second, science is fun because everybody can enjoy it.

For example, say one student does an experiment everyone in the class can experience it because they all witnessed it. Lastly, science is the most fun to make a lesson about because it involves you talking to other people and sharing your observations. For example, If you did a egg drop experiment, you will compare your results to different types of students in your school and hopefully learn from what you did wrong or the opposite. Therefore, science is fun because you get to deal with experiments.

Secondly, one lesson I would like to teach is science because it is the most easiest to teach to many students and adults. First, science is the most easiest because it does not require you to memorize or remember something every single time. For example in other subjects unlike science you have to memorize the root words for English, or memorize the formulas for math, But here all you have to do is memorize the terminology and you should be good to go. Another reason why science is the easiest is because it is involves experiments which are not hard to understand all it requires you to do it pay attention. For example, If you pay attention to the experiment then you will know every bit of it, But in math you have to keep on practicing again and again until you get it. Third, science is the most easiest to many students because it involves drawing pictures which is the most easiest way to understand something other than memorizing. For example, say that the students don't get it by words so, what you can do is illustrate for them so they get what you are trying to say. This works best in science because because science is the subject that involves the most of drawing and experimenting. So at last, science is the best subject to teach about because it is the most easiest to understand.

Thirdly, I would like to create a lesson about science because it is most used in daily life. Firstly, it is most used in daily life because everything can relate to science. For example, it can be related to light because light can cause radiation, it can be related to the air conditioning because it involves air traveling in currents. All of these thing are related to science and there is certainly more. Secondly, Science can help you understand more of your daily life by performing a lesson. For example, say that you don't know how to use a compass, science can tell you the answer to that because it relates to the magnetic field. Last, science is the most used in daily life for fixing things and being able to understand how things work. For example, science can tell us a lot of information, some examples can be how does a circuit work, how do fix a circuit, how does a light turn on so fast, or other possible things too. In addition, science should be the lesson because it is the most used in real life.

In conclusion, one lesson I would like to teach in elementary school is science because it is the most fun and makes a lot of students smile when they do science, it is the most easiest to teach because it involves minimum talking but a lot of drawing, and lastly it is the most frequently used in real life. So therefore, I should get my science lesson ready for the elementary school students soon because they would have the most fun in this while learning. Would you teach science why or why not?

9947BA6C3149,"The option of distance learning can be helpful for students in many ways. Internet have the access of having to take classes online or communicating with a teacher. Students can get the same knowledge in school or in their house but easier. Bullying is the major problem in school;however, teachers can avoid bully by having the option of distance learning. Teenagers might be bad influence for other teenagers by forcing students to drink,smoke, or even worse to use drugs. The majority of students have responsibilities to take care of after school, taking other classes online,taking care of their siblings, or have a job.

Even though teachers try to avoid bully, is hard to make sure students are well behave some do not listen at all and not care or some are lazy. Some student's lives are tough for many reasons it can be by their parents that do not pay attention to them, stress by having too much school work, or some of them have already a job, and adding one more by bully, it can bring bad consequences. In many cases students suicide because of the stress, or they are tired of people not paying attention to them, and not care about what happens in their life. They are cases that teachers are aware of bully, but they ignore the fact that the school is not a save place to be anymore and that they are big problems going on at the school and having to deal with it is better than having to call their parents and do something about it. Teenagers do not realized the fact that they can be responsible for someones death and they be can put in jail by many years, and ruin their live by making fun of someone,or punching other students, it can be something silly and that little things can ruin their lives.

Some students might be a bad influence for other students by forcing them to do several things that can bring consequences for the rest of their lives by being in jail,being unhealthy,or change their life in a bad way. In this days is normal or cool for a student to drink, smoke, use drugs and forcing other students to do the same. The ""if you do not do this I am not your friend no more"", or "" you do not love me if you do not this"" or even worse ""if you do not drink with me I am going to tell everyone your secrets"" that makes students be afraid of losing their friend, girlfriend/boyfriend forcing them to make actions that do not beneficial them at any pint of their lives. Teachers in high school are though to students; however, some students do not care about their education at all and they go to school to talk to a friend or distract other students effecting other students education. Some students are always energetic, getting in trouble all the time,distracting other students, being a bad influence, instead of giving them referrals or suspending them it can be recommend to do home school to avoid any type of problems.

It is a good idea to start saving money for college/future and having a job. It is difficult to study or do homework while having a job students get stress and frustrated to have to attended to school and a job. School waste time in lunch or having other activity when students can do all their work in home and a few hours they are done and can take care of other responsibilities. In students houses can take their time and not have to rush in a assignment or in a test, having the opportunity to not get stress over school work. Having to wake up at the morning it is a hard thing to do for the majority of students, not having a good rest at night can effect students by ,grades, not concentrating, falling asleep at class, not paying attention,always been tired,or skipping some classes can effect when they graduate.

In conclusion having the opportunity to do home school can make a big difference in a good way to the school and to the students education. That it is something that can be a easy way to learn and have the same knowledge like the other students, but in easier way. Internet have the access to many apps to help students can be a fun way to learn instead be sitting in a classroom for two hours. Students can avoid the fact that are some students that do not care at all and if they do not care about their live they are more possible not care about other student education. Going to school now it is something that some teenagers do not considerate important student can take any class online.

E7EBDBDD703F,"Do curfews keep teenagers from getting into trouble? The city council is still currently debating on either adopting the curfew to be at 10 p. m. during the week days or at midnight on the weekends. If teenagers were to be out after the hours selected, it would be considered breaking the law. The laws are choosen for many reasons, even if we don't agree with most of them; we have to obey the laws. I believe the city council should adopt the cerfew for the minnors. When it comes to under age people in this world we have to be more conserned for their safety, it is best to have curfews. We should consider all the dangerous things going on in this world.

Have you considered all the things that could happen when your child is out? There is many dangerous things going on in this world. I'm not saying something will happen but honestly nowadays anything could happen. Without an adults care vision many things could occur. Many minnors are being killed or harmed for reasons we don't know. A curfew is one way from preventing those things from happening to your children. Even though a curfew at midnight on a weekend could still be dangerous; it is our responsability to teach the minnors from right to wrong. If we get them to understand why it is important to have a curfew they would be exrta careful. Theres a high possability they won't want to listen about their curfew; I can speak for myself I would want to spend more time with my friends there was a few times I didn't listen to my mom. I relized how much my safety ment to my mother and how worried she would be when i would be out late.

Have you heard about what happened to Generic_Name in New York? He was such a good child. His mother talk about how he loved hanging out with his nephews and family. She said he wouldn't go out with friends, he would always be home. He was very close to his sister, they'd always be together. Generic_Name had good grades in school, he would never get into trouble at all. The reason I bring his story life into this essay is because he was killed a few blocks away from is house, outside a little food market. I'm not so sure about the time but it was after dark. It was a group of guys who saw him, dragged him out the market and stabbed him under his arm. He tryed asking for help but no one would help him; he tryed getting to a hospital by foot unfortunaly Generic_Name didn't make it and died on the sidewalk. Those guy were caught a few months later and said they confused him with another guy. Generic_Name had no fault in any of it,he didn't deserve it. Maybe if he would of wanted for the next day or if his mom would of took him things could of happened diffrently. My point is leaving your house alone isn't so safe, when your with your parents it goes completey different.

Some people might think they would give the freedom they wanted as a child to there children. They might think there isn't a problem with them going out when ever they'd like and don't think they need a curfew. Everyone wants to enjoy their life and live it fully. Enjoying life doen't have to be passed your curfew, theres more to see during the day. Yes, you might trust your child so much you believe it's okay for them to leave but do you believe in the other people with your child being out in pulic? During day is much more safe then at night time when it's dark. One reason being is because of how many peolpe are out during the day. You could scream for help, run or give signs of being in danger. At night everyone is sleeping, and barely anyone is around.

In conclusion, the city council should think about the things going on in this world and do what's best for the teenagers, which is to have a curfew. Teenagers can still have their freedom and enjoy every bit of their lifes with curfews. I think it would be for the best; everyone would be safe in that way. Mostly everyone can agree that their minnors safety is important. Curfews would also keep teenagers from getting into trouble.

2D8464A3BD5B,"One year ago. I though that business was the career that I wanted to study, but it was really hard to me. I could not do anything good in that class. I was fail that class and I was really stressful I did not knew what to do. I realized that business it was not for me, but I though that was to late to change my decision. I talk with my counselor and she said that I could change the career. So, I

decided to chose another career and now I know what career it is the right one for me. I do not know if I going to change it again, because I can be a undecided person. As well, I realized that happens every time that it was normal. I talk with my classmate, and they say that same thing happen with them. Although some say that is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because students can select courses in their high schools to help them improve in their right career, actually it is a bad idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because students might select a wrong career that is not right for them and students can be undecided in what they want to study.

Some say that is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because students can select courses in their high schools to help them improve in their right career. The only problem is that they do not know that is a problem for students. Everyday I heard students, classmate or even my friends that said '' This class is really hard for me, but I can not change it because this class help me improve my career"".

That words make me think that they are unhappy and stressful.

The best way to help students is that they can change a new career. Maybe that career that they are starting are not for them or students can be undecided in what they want to study, and they just pick one.

There is a lot of reasons why is a bad idea that students commit to a career at a young age, but I just have two of them.

In addition, it is a bad idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because students might select a wrong career that is not right for them. The dream of all kids it is to be like their parents. They want to study the career that their parents studied, even go to the same university they parents go. Sometimes is different their parents put pressures on them to studied a career that they dont want. So, students chose the career that their parents studied or they parents wants them to study . Then they realized that the career they pick is not right for them. This is a problem because now students are unhappy and stressful. Sometimes they wants to quit school because they think school is hard for them. When is just because they pick the wrong career. If someone do a statistic about how students feel about their career that they chose. I think the probability of that students said that they think the career they pick is not for them will be above of one hundred percent.

Also, it is a bad idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because students can be undecided in what they want to study. There are a lot of career that students can pick, it is difficult just pick one. Students can find skills that help them in another career. Even though their skills are good in the career they pick before. They decide to pick another career. Sometime the decision that students takes are not the right one, but they continue experiment new careers. That is basically life is about, decision. When students takes a wrong decision in their careers. they are learning. Maybe students decides to learn two careers or more than two they take different course or classes to achieves their goals. I think students can be undecided in what they want to study and that is the best thing that help them in their career, is good that students can experiment different courses.

In conclusion, it is a bad idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because students might select a wrong career that is not right for them and students can be undecided in what they want to study. Sometimes students can be very impulsive and can chose whatever career they want, but they not realize what career is the right one. Also, students sometimes could not decide what career they want to study. The best way to help students is to let them know what they want to learn. I think students will be more decide in whatever they want to study.

CE19B516A167,"should the school board add one and a half hour to school each day? The school board should add one and a half hours to school each day. I agree with the school board plane to add one and a half hour to school because it would effect the students learning and help them get more smarter and it would effect the school worker's because they money they get payed will increase.

1 first of all the school board plane to add one and a half hour to school each day.

if the school board add one and half hour to school if will effect the student because they will be able to have more time to study with they teacher which help them gain more learning. for an example when Generic_Name was 10years old in Generic_City, he use to not like school because he had school from 7am to 4pm and the teacher's use to force them to do homework,classwork and all the learning he needed it felt like being a maid having someone telling him to do this and that he hated the teacher but he learned a lot from them and him and his classmate still cared they teacher's teaching everywhere they went and it's very helpful, for an example they teacher's was like your parent's telling you to do something you don't wanna do they know is good for you but still you don't wanna do it so they force you to do it then you get mad over them for doing that which they find it helpful for you later in life in fact you hate them at that moment for what they did, but after years when your adult you get struggle about something and you remember what she thought you and you find it helpful the how our teacher's was like back then in Generic_City, the more hour's we had the more smarter we got . This evidence show's that the more time we got learning with our teacher's the more smarter we got. clearly sometime's the teacher's rush teaching when they do not have enough time and that does not help the student so the more time the teacher's get to teach the more student understand the subject well without rushing through the subject.

2 I agree with the school adding one hour and a half to school each day.

perhaps if they do add one hour and a half to school each day it really help the student and teacher's because they will have enough time learning not rush through learning. for an example when i was in school back then in Generic_City, Generic_Name was in classes doing his work but the classes hour's was short so this time when he did not have enough time to do the classwork in class the class hours was like

1hour and 30minites in math class the teacher told us to '' turn your work in it's time to go '' innocent didn't have enough time so he try to rush through it so he can get it done.

after week's innocent got 60% on my classwork he was disappointed in himself innocent wished he had more time to finish it was not the teacher's fault so he didn't blame the teacher because they did they best to make sure we had enough time. if we had enough time it would had really helped us all student's and teacher's.

in addition for student's to have better grade they need more time to focus and do they work in class.

clearly if school board add one hour and a half to school it will effect student's grade because they will have enough time to do they work in class and not rush.

In conclusion the school board should add one hour and a half because it will effect student learning and it will also effect they grades too so it will be a good thing to add one hour and half to school each day sometimes the student don't have enough time to do they work and they need sometime to finish but they can't and that effect the decrease the student grades. like in the story when the boy name Generic_Name in his school they didn't have enough time to do they classwork so he rushed through it and got bad grade, so if student's have enough time to do they work in class it would be very helpful to the student's. if the school board add one hour and half the student's grade will be different all they need is just more time to do they work in class and not rush through they work the more time they get to do they work the better they grades will get and the smarter they become.

EA04020F5ECD,"when people ask you for advice they sometimes talk to more people than one they ask they ask for a good advice becuase if they will not have good advice they can't think about a good decision somtimes a person who have trouble in her or his life or any depression our any happiness in thier life they can't make control thier a control on them. so they get pannic sometimes they can't think what to do they don't know how to do things so that's why they from many people but when they seeks multiple opinions so they get confiused they can't select one opinion that is good for them they want to think about that but they can't do that so they ask many people for different opinions so that's good but also not good tho but so they need to figure that what they should do or what not what i think is it's ok to ask people thier opinions but we should also need to think use our mind whithout our mind we can not do any thing the opinions that are given by other people we should think about them like what are they saying what's the point is it good for us or not or if i will follow this opinion it will make trouble for me or not then u will ask your friend or a person that is so close to you if that person will say yes you will be like ok than . lets do it!

so you do a whole long procisior for getting a one good opinion what you need to do is that ask opinions from two or three people and then if u think it's not a good opinion than think your own and then take a good decission. everyone takes thier own decission i think if you wanna ask for a opinion find a good trustful adult who really really wants to help you who will give you a better choice and then think about it if you think that she or he is right then just follow the directions for example i have a birthday party and i need to select the dresses for everyone and arrange the birthday party and i don't have enough time i am so worried and confiused i don't known what to do .

i need a help from people i asked from my friends, cousins ,family, teachers and then i think that i have a lot of opinions so i can't choose

1 so what i did was i asked my older cousine and then we discused about that she told me in details what to do and then i managed my time and i choosed the dresses i arranged the birthday party in one week everything was so good that's how we make better chioce for our self if u can't do that at least think on your own or ask for help and ask from a good person not anyone you don't know well becuase people can play with you so we have to be carefull so i think asking an adult is more better than asking a lot of people becuase asking an adult will help you more becuase the first time i need help and i asked a lot of people and i was so confiused and i was like what is going on with me because it was my first excperience i didn't use my mind it was so bad waste of time every thing was ruined and that's why i learned something is never do anything that your parents or adult don't like here is another way to make a better choice and that is always listen to your parents and your adult because sometimes the decisions that you are making it seems like they are good but after some time you realize that it's not good for you u get in trouble and all you have face somethings so thats why do what your parents are telling you to do not what you wants to do it's ok to listen to your heart but sometimes it's not so the best way to make a better choice is listen your parents and adult

2nd is use your mind to think that it's good or bad the 3rd way is to ask someone who is an adult and such a nice and truthfull person believe in your self and your god these are the best ways to make a better choice we should always believe in your self and your parents because they will always tell you a thing that is good for you no matter what it is just think that yuor parents tell you to do that and again believe in yourself if you will everything will be good if you be feel good believe in your god becuase he will help you everywhere he is with you so these are the best way to make a good choices are these..",1.5,1.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.638854,2.508648,2.898968,2.6734781,2.474456,2.4680798,2.9898288,2.76883,2.8778741,2.8915875,2.418893,2.5493562,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,863,6,0.2572421784472769,143.83333333333334,24,5,"{'1', 'trustful', 'wan', 'tho', 'somethings'}"
7726A1F9C660,"The violin is a hard instrument to master, even with many years. It takes hours and hours of practices and skill to enjoy putting your time into it. I always had a great amount of interest in violins as a kid. Soon enough, I was given lessons for the violin. Somethings skills you would want to have is patience, knowing to push yourself to a current limit, and enjoying it. With those skills, my talent on the violin has increased over the years and overcame phases.

When I first shown interest in violins, as I remember, was in Generic_City back in 2008. We were at a gas station on a road trip, and stopped to eat. I saw a kid magazine with a toy violin that came along with it. That really caught my attention, as I begged my mom to buy me it. Eventually, she gave in and bought me the toy violin. I pretended like it was a real violin, and strung the strings with my fake bow. Ever since I had gotten that toy violin, I would not stop bringing it everywhere with me. After a few years went, I had moved to Generic_City and my parents decided I should actually get lessons on the violin in 2013. On the first lesson, I felt really nervous because my wish was finally coming true. I really thought I was going to be perfect on the first day. Of course, I was not good at all on day one. Soon, came to my realization that the violin is something you could not master in just in a year. My dad had made me a daily schedule for me to practice everything, so I could increase my talent and abilites. That's how I was able to go through the ""first phase"" of violin lessons went by.

Saturday afternoons felt super weird since I was not attending any lessons. My family and I had moved back to Generic_City, and I did not have any violin lessons. During the last two years of the four, in Generic_City I had be slacking off from my practices. Yet, I still wanted to continue with my talent and not give up. After a few months went by in Generic_City, I begged my parents to let me take lessons on violin. It was dejavu all over again from 7 years ago. We found out there was after-school lessons I could take. Suddenly, everything felt like the very first lesson I took in 2013. The new instructor said I was pretty good and could immediately start on the second book, instead of the first ""beginners"" book. It felt great knowing I was off to a great start.

Everything was going fine for the next five months, until I started to slack off again but worse. I always enjoyed playing the violin, but it began a chore. I was not improving as much, as I was back in Generic_City. I did not feel happy about the violin for the next three years. The thoughts of how the violin was not going to take me anywhere always lingered in my mind. It was not my dream to be a famous violinist or an instructor. Reasons just kept piling up till I told my parents about my thoughts and feelings. They had told me it would be a waste of six years worth of money for me to give up. I still practiced and slightly improved, but I still unhappy. You can tell if someone is doing something they clearly don't want to do, but are forcing themselves. After countless of arguments, cries, and rants to friend, I realized that no one can convince me to enjoy the violin again instead, I had to convince myself to. Our family was moving once again, but to Virginia. Every since we left Generic_City, I had not touched a violin in a year and that is when I was reminiscing on the days when I was playing the violin. I thought to myself, why did I hate practicing and going to lessons so much? The violin is something that I could never let go of because of the amount of work and years put into it. I would love to improve on my talent more instead of throwing it all out, it would be a big waste to do so.

You should always push yourself to a current limit though, not until you breakdown. But you can give a lot of time to decide whether or not you will ever be happy from doing something you don't currently want to do. It could really be just a phase you could be having. The best feeling is honestly really great knowing that you weren't pushing yourself to do something you didn't want to do anymore. That is how I grew my skills, and my talent in violin more. I also grew to enjoying the violin more.

E6CF2D3B4FA2,"Examples are what makes a readers/audiences be able to get attracted with what the reason the writer is talking about. Since I have used examples in many things things in my life, I personally think that they could help you with a topic that other people are trying to talking about. And since the question is basically asking if ""examples are good to influences people that are trying to do something or does examples are useless and are not really helpful at all?"" I said that Examples are good to influence other people. And here are the reasons why it is a good influential if you are striving for a long- term goal.

Not many reasons are able to support what you are trying to basically explain or prove. What made me think of this is because if you put a reason that isn't strong enough to even support what you are saying, then basically a reason isn't strong enough if you are trying to influence someone. Like for example, if the topic says that anyone can become famous and the reason is ""work hard and never give up."" that really isn't strong enough to influences someone that actually wants to become that type of guy. But if you put a real life example like ""this person name Generic_Name that was a low-class, lives in a 1 bedroom apartment, and makes not a lot of money. And he heard that he can become a rich person. So he was working hard and he saved up on investment. And somehow he actually became the person that he wanted to be."" that is a example that could be used if you are trying to persuade someone.

Examples can be kept as like a precious thing for people. Why this is also important is because if you actually lets say achieve something that you wanted to accomplish for such a long time. You can always remember that thing that made you kept pushing forward, and to never let down what you wanted to do for such a long time. Like for example, a person named Generic_Name made his dream become a reality; which it was to become a architect that works under a famous person. And when he had to make a speech, he remembered a women who was going through exactly the same thing he was going through. And he said that her life will be something he is going to cherish forever because her background is what made him become who he is now. Which everyone can look at for being influenced by this person right here.

Examples can actually change many peoples lives because of what they say or just their background. What made me choose this reason? well it was because for the past 16 years of my life, I have always seen many people change their lifestyle because of what people are saying to change them. Like for example, when I was in 8th grade, I had a science teacher that was really nice to everyone and respected them as if we were like his child. And all of the students asked him ""why did you decide to become a science teacher?"" And his response was ""I became a science teacher because I like teaching about sciences and the life of our society. And because of a man that i was inspired by. And everyone knows who this guy is? His name is Bill Nye The Science Guy. The reason why i choose him was because during my time when i was in collage , he was the only person that i knew that actually did science. And I wanted to watch his show. And I was amazed by all the chemicals, types of rocks, everything that has to do with science. And since that happened, i have enjoyed being a science teacher for 10 years."" And this speech shows that people will not be able to reach their goal unless you have a motivational quote, speech, or background of a famous person.

While i do think that Examples are good to influence other people that are trying to reach their goal, I still kind of personally think that there are examples that don't really help/influence people. Why I think of that is because people don't find examples of influential that aren't interesting or appealing to them at all because it's doesn't suit them. Like for example, there was a kid who wanted a game that could make him play it all the time. And he saw a commericial about a game that is coming out next week, and he was getting suprised at first, but when he saw a interview about the game, he wasn't really amazed anymore because what the game director talked about wasn't influencing other poeple at all. So there are some examples that really can't influences them. But most of the time, there are so many examples that are out there in the world that actually changed peoples lives, and their mind about something.

C40BB9E0BC6C,"Should success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.

l agree with what Churchill's about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. Failure is to do or perform. l agree because some people think that if you are failure it mean you can not be success, you will be success no matter what. Some people preform good in ever where they go and do what will make they there success so this is important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success without loss of enthusiasm.

First reasons, ln the world people will say that failure don't make they life by success so if they did something and they fail that all, they will never try it again because they did not get good thing from the fist one. Be strong in everything you are doing failure will not be without loss of enthusiasm. For example My brother wife have an exam to write in the morning so she was learning all the night she did not asleep so l went to her room and tell her to sleep some time before morning and she said no l have to learn so that l can pass me exam and l said OK then am going to sleep. ln the morning she get up and she went to write the exam. The next day they call her and told her that she fail her exam so all what she was thinking was that she will pass the exam but she will failure so she was thinking that she will be success in this exam but she did not loss of enthusiasm.

Also, Most of the people give up if they fail in thing they are doing they believe in them self that what they are doing will be successful for they but the end thing will miss up for them and the loss of enthusiasm the good ideas of bring success tell your that l can do this and do it all. For example, l was write am SOL exam last year and l don't know what to write and l don't understand what the question is say so l was thinking about the question but l don't know what to write so l tell my self that no matter what the question is l will do it and pass it. When the score came because l believe in my self l pass the exam. So you can be success in every thing you do if you made up your Maine in what you are doing. Make your self a good discuss and you will be fine.

However, Some people start their own business but they first tell them self my business will be successful and yes they will be because they believe first before they start the business. Yes the work will be good without loss of enthusiasm. For example, My friend dad has a big shop in Generic_City one night when her dad was asleep some bad people came to the shop to take all his money and the thing in the shop so in the morning people was cry infant of the shop so we all went there l see what is going there so when we went there it was so sad they bad people took everything in the shop not even a pen but do know something he did not give up because he did not give up he fail but he was successful in what he was doing. The reasons why am telling all this is that never tell your self that l will be failure on matter what you will be success.

Other might say that it is bad ideas to be success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. However you can loss enthusiasm any time but if you never give up in what you are doing people do things that they don't believe in what they. One of my teacher in my school called Generic_Name gave as a test and the test was as difficult for as to do so he told him self how can the student do this work so try not to give the test to as the student in the classroom told him that we will can do the test so the teacher the told as that do you believer that you can do it and we said yes we can so he gave as the test to do. infant all the student that told that test pass successfully and the teacher was so happy. So you will be success without loss of enthusiasm.

ln contusion, We have many things in the world that will make you a failure or success, make a discuss to yourself that you will success in life no matter how how things will go. My friends always told me that never give up in life, school and any thing you do. Maybe you have an exam today and when you went home yesterday you did not learn and you was watch TV and you want to pass the exam no matter what you will be failure in the exam. ls important to be success in life if you can be success you have to do what will make you success. l believe in my self that being a success is a good idea.",2.5,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.5,2.7327816,2.5822387,2.9396343,2.7045121,2.4380026,2.5712836,2.2769845,2.151127,2.3963683,2.091632,1.5257002,2.2529004,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,909,29,0.2376237623762376,31.344827586206897,8,6,"{'ln', 'preform', 'ls', 'contusion', 'exam', 'sol'}"
EBEFF43F46EE,"If you could accomplish one thing in the future, what would you choose? Something I would like to accomplish in the future would be attending and graduating college because it will make me feel successful, it will help me learn what I need in order to get my dream job, and I wanna be able to be one of the first and only people in my family to say I finished college.

The first reason why I would like to accomplish college in the future is because it will make me feel successful. Attending college has always been a dream of mine since I was a little kid because I'd always watch documentaries; in these documentaries people would talk about what they had to do in order to feel that their lives were successful, some people had the same reason which was that they had made the choice of attending and finishing college. Being able to have the chance to even attend college is amazing, not everyone in the world is given this opportunity. I know that college is a long time away for me but it's coming sooner than I think. Before I know it I'm going to be out of high school and out in the real world. In order for me to feel like I'm successful I need to finish college. College gives you the information to be successful in the job of your choosing. To me being successful mean you never give up even when things get hard. These are all examples why accomplishing college would make me feel successful.

The second reason why I would like to accomplish college in the future is because it will help me learn what

I need to know in order to get my dream job. Most jobs out in the world require you to have a higher education than high school. College helps you learn specifically about the job you want to do when you become an adult; the job I wanna learn all about is a pediatric oncologist. Being a pediatric oncologist has been my dream job for awhile now because I think that cancer is such a sad thing; people die everyday from cancer. When I get older I want to be able to help treat and get rid of children cancer so that they an live their lives to the fullest; to me helping these kids get rid of their cancer could help prevent it form ever coming back; it doesn't mean that there is a zero percent chance that their cancer won't come back, but I want to help these kids lives last as long as possible. In order for me to actually have the opportunity to apply and receive this job, I can't just have a high school diploma. There are jobs out in the world that do not require you to have a college education; maybe your dream job may not require you to attend school after you finish high school, but not all jobs are like this. These are all examples why college will help me learn what I need to know in order to get the job of my dreams.

The third and final reason why I would like to accomplish college in the future is because I wanna be one of the first and only people in my family to say I finished college. A lot of people in my family have not attended college due to not having the funds to afford it, having to stay home to take care of a family member, and most just didn't see the point of even attending in the first place. I know that no matter what my parents would do whatever was needed to be able to give me the opportunity to attend college. Personally, one of the really big reasons why I want to finish college is because of my mom. While my mom was attending college she ended up having me; she was a single parent at the time and she did whatever she needed to provide for me. One thing she never got to do was finish college. She stopped all of her dreams just so she could always be there for me. My mom has such a big influence n my life and I want to be able to finish college for her; I want her to see that all of her hard work payed off and make her proud. Knowing I have my mom supporting me no matter what keeps me going everyday, I don't give up on things to show her that I can do anything I put my mind to. Overall, this is why I want to be one of the first and only people in my family to say I finished college.

In conclusion, not everyone may want to accomplish the same thing, everybody is different, but at then end of the day there's one thing that I want to accomplish the most. Something I would like to accomplish in the future would be attending and graduating college because it will make me feel successful, it will help me learn what I need in order to get my dream job, and I wanna be able to be one of the first and only people in my family to say I finished college.",4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,3.5,4.0,3.9368658,3.9910614,4.0954447,4.078886,4.0332932,3.987876,4.6707544,4.03821,4.3276143,4.199574,3.869713,4.457276,4.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,903,31,0.2790697674418604,29.12903225806452,6,10,"{'pediatric', 'mom', 'oncologist', 'documentaries', 'diploma', 'accomplishing', 'wo', 'wan', 'awhile', 'payed'}"

Students use phone they will looking for YouTube,and they learn some think there video. when students doing online classes attend if they didn't know that they will be taping the Google and students get some information.

First, students should be benefit from being able to attend classes from home because, sometime students doesn't have time when students free they will be done there homework,test, assessment. some word students doesn't understand but they will be taping on the phone and translation from another languish or they will be looking for dictionary. where students doesn't matter because they will be doing online class any area, any place. example:-1. students traveling to bus workplace,rest time, talk to another person. many parent think students does,t leading any think at home they are always use the phone and play game, taxing masses,talk to another person said parent, But not like that one because they will leading some think there. student taxing another person students learning to spell correct. when student talk to friend the will learn to correct tone.

Second, students should be benefit from being able to attend classes from home because,some students doesn't have parents so, they need to work and make money pay for rent and food. Students work a lot so,students not attend classes. i know how will be going to schools they leaning a lot. when students not understand teacher enplane every think and explain math. at schools have time what time students enter the class what time go to next class and what time lunch every think teacher make time table. students follow the rule. some students it's fine this rule some students it's not find this rule. So, students at home take online classes they will be make a time table. Schools have teacher to learn and at home we have friend,brother and sister every body teach them. if students does't have a family they will call the friend and talk and discourse to the project and homework. My be they doing go to Google and taping problem sentence and students gets some answer. Students learn to fast looking for video.

Third, students should be benefit from being able to attend classes from home because, some time students will be sick and students won't attend classes. if that time students have online classes students doing homework and project,assessment at hospital and at home. Students sitting in the hospital they are boring if students have some attend class they are doing some online classes. And they students have time going to fast. Students attend classes finish they doing some plan. But, students doesn't to make plant January is to rarely to know this information because, students plan after depend school on there teacher and consular. And summer , winter vacation too and there plane my be change. So, students,would benefit from being able to attend classes from at home.

Finally, students should be benefit from being able to attend classes from home because, now every area social online. So, some time students take vacation and going to visiting some place and they will be attend onion classes. students use of cellphone with at home and work traveling time so students attend online classes. schools have five day a week a class so students want to spent time with family. students want to go to vacation with family looking for new place. students want to all the time free. they don't want stay one place. When students will be go to new place students mind fresh and they think they will be doing every thing. So online classes should benefit for students. When student mind fresh there mind new think they learn new word. So students active doing every thing and students tell there friends and they will be decide go to there pace.

B86530090737,"There are lots of activities one can to do outdoors. Many people now a days stay in there home and play video games. There is so much to do outdoors like you can go rock climbing. Rock climbing is a very fun, dangerous, and healthy outdoor activity to do. Many people who do rock climbing are living the happiest and healthiest life they can. You can also do hunting. Hunting is also a fun outdoor activity you can do, but it requires risk to do. Hunting is done by a gun which many people cant use or dont have but hunting is a fun activity to do if you do have a gun and know how to use it.

you can also go to parks. Parks are really enjoyable, there is lots of fun stuff to do in a park. There are slides, swings and other fun stuff. There are also animals some times in a park. its like a park and zoo mixed together. people can really enjoy there self in parks. Parks are not only for little kids and there are not always slides,swings, monkey bars etc. in a park. There are some parks that are only made for people who like to jog, run and walk. There are so many different kind of parks.

One of the most enjoyable thing you can do is play a sport, like Soccer, Football, Baseball, Tennis etc. There are many places outdoor you can go to play. There are soccer fields made for people who like to play soccer. There are Football fields etc. Sports are not only fun but they also are healthy for you. Like in Soccer there is nothing you can do accept running after the ball. Football is also fun and healthy for you and many other sports. Doing something outdoors is way more fun than doing something inside. If you play video games all the time you can lose your eyes and you can get fat easily.

You can also go to the beach. Beach is the most funnest and enjoyable place. There is sand. ocean, sun, waves and other fun stuff. if you cant swim you can also stay in the sand and make a sand castle or something like that. If you do know how to swim you can go to the ocean and swim in the waves and have lots have fun. If you dont want to swim and make sand castle you can just lay on your towel ad enjoy the hot sun. If you are with your friends and family you can also play lots of different games like frisky, Tag, etc. You can play music on a boombox or a speaker and have fun with that.

Another fun activity to do outside is skydiving. If you want to fly skydiving is just the thing for you. It is another one of the most fun outdoor activities but it requires skill and lots of confidence to do a skydive. If you dont know how to open or use a parachute you will not be skydiving alone you will be tied to professional skydiver and you will skydive with him/her. You still need the confidence to skydive or you can have a heart attack or you can pass out and passing out in the midair is not very good for you, you can break your neck with the air pressure or die.

Skydiving is not really healthy but it still is fun and enjoyable.

Hiking is also one of the outdoor activity and it is really fun. In hiking you can go to mountain peeks or just walk to the middle of a mountain. Hiking is similar to rock climbing but you dont have to climb rocks you just have to walk on the track and and have fun. hiking is also one one of healthy outdoor activities. Once you reach your goal you can enjoy the view and be proud of yourself. Hiking is not an easy thing to do there are many rocks and unstable ground on the way but if you do hiking often it will be easy for you.

Camping is also one of the outdoor activities. camping is fun and enjoyable but it is also dangerous and risky. Camping is when you alone or with your friends go to a forest or camping spot and live there in a tent for one or four days. camping is so much fun especially if you are with your friends or family. you can cook yourself food, enjoy the nature etc. If you like nature camping is just the thing for you. camping can be dangerous and risky because there are a lot of dangerous animals in the woods like lion, bear etc. but if you pick the right camping spot for yourself then there is no danger. many camping spots are where there are less harmful animals.

Outdoor activities are fun to do. Most people dont them because they waste all of there time time on video games and indoor stuff. Most people dont like nature and the are discussed of it. outdoor activities are fun and healthy for you they can keep you in shape and you can have the time of your life. Outdoor activity is for people who really like nature and want to stay healthy.

B3145EA3395B,"To see someone impression, that might be possible to chang. Because the majority of people might be mad when from somthing when we see them from the first time, I disagree with this statement because most people chang there impressions when they're in a spicific mood, Some might change after a proplem has been solved. Because when I was yonger from now my dad allways use too tell me

""too mach agreement kills a chat"". Many peple chang thier imperssions after the first time we see them.

So I have a frined who allways chang her mood by any time, some times she would come to my house and knock on the door even if we were just argued about something, but when I saw her the first time when we met she was very nice and my parent invited her to my house and her first time her impression was very happy and intersted to see us and learen about our culture, so when I saw her the next day we were so happy that we met. and I told her my trip how we came to the US, she was so impress to know more about us, But some time she woluld change becaus of her parents and when she's sad she comes to my house and tell me how she has been and how her family is with her, and I was listen to her as she tells me every thing, But when some one come to our house and see's her like that they say that she's wired from how she acts, but her first imression was't like that, she changes with what impact throw her life, and we're a teens also, Every day my parents sees her they say that she's very talented because she has a very good voice and I use to be so happy to see her singing because she had a good voice, but her impreesion changed after I saw her how she reacts with others, and I use to get surprised of how she's diffeent with methen others, but now I found that people are like a door each person need a spacial key to open them and understand how they feel and think. To see people's impression, I have to look at them when they are in thier good time that will chang the ideas. and to affect especially forcibly or deeply to some one's mind when they see some one impressions for the first time.

I encorage everyone to change thier opinion about the first impression are almost impossible to change. Because the majority of people impression can chang etheir over time or by the area sourounding them, and figer out how make time to understand how it goes and how people thier features from influence by the socity around us and how I said can give the impress with your senserity follow people's impressions, and literally the word impression is the sence of feeling in how someones feeling from sirten situation.

Seeing the reality, Most humans have their way of reactions to react to every thing they can show or chang by somehow in their life, In this period of time no one like to listen to someone's story, Real people who shows their impressions by the area sourounding them it effects us as who we are and the time that we are in, So the place that we are often been can effect our impressions, The place that we been raised in can impact on our impression. People's reactions might chang after an accident happen to some one's in the past It can be a very big and huge chang for some one's reactions if we see them the next time or day. Places and moumints can be on of the reasons why people impressions are mostly can change by this way, This kind of things might be wired to be impossible. Emotions and there behavioral changes in some bodeis deppend on how they think by a word or emotinal apperance can be changed with their behavioras, and some might be in need so bad for somthing and that can also shows their impressions behavioral chang.

When I was in my country many people came to the area where we live there was so many that your mind can't relate to what we see and we all were very nice to them and we gave them many of the things that we have and as much we can, There was so many kids from them I use to be realy sad when I see them like that I refused to give every thing I can to them but some of them was vrery hungry and some are mean but I said to my self in my mind that their impreesion won't be like that if they weren't in need like that. So to see people impression we have to see thier past and what they been throw, Many of them change there mood, and some might change after a prolem has been solved.",2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.736635,2.5615997,2.944946,2.717388,2.4179115,2.4352453,2.9316022,2.6844106,3.2556741,3.187676,2.846157,2.4370236,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,864,16,0.3171296296296296,54.0,41,6,"{'someones', 'spacial', 'wo', 'behavioral', 'forcibly', 'reacts'}"
D684AE8A9418,"Many people are going say that we can be our self, but even though we can be as we want in certain things, our character is formed by influences beyond our control because we tend to try to fit in society, we fear making mistakes, and we try to be like someone we admire.

As humans we tend to try to fit in society; we like to feel liked by the people around us, so we act different than we actually are. The feeling of being liked by society in most cases makes us feel pride and self confidence, which is fine but makes a line between being our self and being influenced. Fitting in a society might be hard for some people,even frustrating, but people still are willing to do it so we can not be seen as different. trying to fit in a society might be the biggest reason why we do not act as we want and tend to act as everyone else in front of other people,because we fear that if society categorize us different then society is going to dislike us,however, there is some people that are careless of what people say about them. There is always someone that will not care at all of what people say about them which is good,but, there is always a time where they cared or will care about it. It is part of being a human that we care about what society says because we do not want be seen as someone different that can not fit. For example, students in schools dress as the trend is, so they can fit in society,even when they grow they will care how they look.

The fear of making mistakes influences part of our character. We fear that making mistakes will make us imperfect or not good at something, therefore, we think that if we are not perfect we are a failure,the fear of making mistakes is what makes us human, and that is a gigantic influence to us and we can not control it but makes people stronger and, help us to develop a character that will represent us in the future. we fear many different things in life for example,our appearance, if we think our appearance is not as we want, we get insecure in many different ways but, it is a huge help in the development of our own character because we learn from those mistakes. Being insecure is a huge obstacle and mistake for people to get to choose their own character, because it does not let us decide for what we really want,therefore people should learn from them which it will hopefully help people to develop a better character. Many people find themselves as insecure because of the fact that people might dislike them. Scientist have said that having the fear of making mistakes will make it harder for people to achieve their most wanted goals in life. We all as humans make mistakes, therefore we can not or it is harder for us to find our own character by our own self.

As humans we all have at least someone that we admire a lot,and we see them as a person we should imitate so we can be even a bit as them. Imitating someone in any way will make our self to struggle when trying to develop our own character because we are thinking of how someone else would think. Imitating someone else that has had such a great impact in life might be good for your self and you might achieve your goal because that person did. Even though our character is formed by influences of other we admire we also have to have our own character into it, so we can feel the pride of achieving a goal that has had our effort in to it. Having a bit of your own character into what you do is important too because it is not a full imitation of what someone else did. Many famous es have said that they also had followed someone else's steps to get where they are, so being influenced by the people you admire might help the people a lot to achieve their goals as it did with the famous people,and they also said that the people they admired a lot was the one helped them to find themselves, because if it was not for them they would have probably the same as they were before being famous.

In conclusion, we can decide how we want to be but that does not remove the fact that our character is mostly formed of influences that we can not control because we tend to try to fit in society,we fear making mistakes, and we try to be like someone we admire a lot. People are going to find themselves mostly from experiences and influences that they can not control,however you should have some of your own character to do things so when you achieve something important you feel better about yourself, but we,the people tend to act different so people like us and it is something inevitable,either control in life. As humans we dont like to be categorized as different and our main goal in a big percentage of people in the world is to fit in society and that is something that can not be controlled, but it helps us a lot to find our self afterwards and form our character at the end.",4.0,4.5,4.5,5.0,4.0,4.5,3.6292276,3.4620683,3.7881913,3.66014,3.428749,3.4954462,4.124788,3.0480654,3.729695,3.3204873,2.903724,2.979288,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,930,24,0.2548387096774193,38.75,2,6,"{'insecure', 'imitating', 'categorize', 'categorized', 'es', 'frustrating'}"

10DA9316D02D,"This program helps students to learn new things,helps older students to mature of teaching and taking it seriously,and helps younger students to socialize with new people and to communicate,and prepares the older students to prepare lessons and teach and be more organized,it can also help older and younger students to learn new different skills and learn different ways.

The first best thing about having programs for younger and older students is for the younger students can learn new things. I think it's best to teach young people to learn new things because it can prepare them in the future. I think that the program can help the younger students for they can learn interesting new things and for they can decide what they want to be in the future. If the younger students get help from the older students to learn new things it's good because for they can use that information and teach other kids what they have learn from the older students. I think this program can help many other young students to learn new things from the older students because it's a better way for the students for can use what they have learn and use it for something for their future life like for example math they can use that for paying taxes and bills I think that this program can help students learn new things.

The second, thing that is good about this program,is the older kids can mature from teaching younger students and learn how to be more thinkable about what to teach and how to teach something. I think that this program is good because the older student learn how to focus more on what they are able to teach the younger students. The reason why I think the program is a good learning resource is because when the older students know more things than the younger students they can decide what do they need help on learning what should I teach them and how do I teach the subject to them so it makes the older students more focus to how to know how teach a younger students and the best way to help them. It helps older students because they can think in a better way and to make them feel more grown up teaching someone that is younger than them. This program helps older students because it makes them think more harder and it also teaches the older students how to think more ideas and thin what happens if they teach that, or well this lesson help them, and makes them ask questions to themselves.

The third reason, how this program can help younger students, is because the younger students can communicate more to new people they don't know. I think that this program helps younger students to communicate more is because if they talk to more new people that are helping them they well be less shy and it well make it less difficult for them to be shy to talking to someone new. I think that this program helps younger student to learn better to communicate is because they can get more confidence, and not be scared to talk in front of someone new and different. I think that this program dose help younger students with communication because when they talk to someone new they can feel more comfortable talking to more people and be more social. This program helps younger people to communicate because when they talk to someone it can help them to be less scared to like present projects and talk to a crowd.

The fourth reason, why this program helps older students to prepare for lessons and be like a more organized,thinkable person. I think that this program dose help older students be more organized is because they think what they are gonna teach them and what the younger students are struggling on. I think that this program dose help a lot of certain older students be organized because they think what time,and day,where they are gonna teach the lessons to the younger students. I think that this program dose really help the older students to be organized cause it makes them more prepare what they are gonna teach and how they are gonna teach it so basically, the older students think were to put what. Why I think that this program dose help older students to be more organized because they plan everything in order.

The last,reason why I think this program is great is because it helps both younger and older students to help each other and to improve there learning skills. I think this program dose help both young and older students because if they all work together and help each other it can make a difference on helping and making people learn in a way certain way an easier way. I think that this program dose help younger and older students cause they can both share their learning skills how they learn things and shares ideas. I think this program helps because all the younger students and older students teach each other things and help them get better at something they are having trouble at doing. I think this program dose help cause it helps every students to learn a easy way to learn in different ways like flashcards,reading something over and over again,watching turturiols videos on how to do a equation or math so this program helps to find the best skill for you. It helps for all the students for they can learn faster and easier and help others find their best learning skill to focus on what they are learning.

It helps both older students and younger students to improve there learning skills and it's a good program to learn new interesting things to help students for the future.

Imagination it's what sparks our creativity. Without imagination, knowledge means nothing because we wouldn't be able to come up with anything. How we create intricate characters and stories and how incredible buildings stand tall. This is due to imagination and how we come up with such things. Take a second and think of your favorite character from any source of media. They were created because someone imagined them and brought them to life. Imagination is all around us from our stories and music to our basic everyday items. That pen on your desk was imagined up to be able to write and pass along information.

For ages people imagined stories and people listened. People and imagined plays,movies,books,TV and video games all with different stories and design. These things may seem insignificant, but people adore these stories and have been inspired. They have been mesmerized by these worlds and characters. Imagination is what leads people to create these stories. These stories have taught us messages and life lessons also. They inspire us to be best version of our self and to follow our dreams, as we see the characters do. We grow close to characters and relate with them, making these stories more special to us. Imagination gave us inspiring role models and heroes, they also gave us a childhood. How we wait to see our favorite cartoon and smile with excitement waiting for the next adventure to unfold. Imagination gave life to unforgettable characters, how Walt Disney created Micky Mouse and countless other. These characters and stories aren't just for children but adults as well. Stories of all genres exist to bring new experiences and worlds to the audience. Imagination gave us stories to inspire,scare,to make us laugh or even cry for the character. Imagination gave life to countless of stories something knowledge could never do alone.

From the Eiffel Tower to an small little house, people imagined buildings and ways to construct them. It's true you need to understand and know how to build but imagination is more important. Imagination is what let us think of such designs. Even in ancient times people put imagination and knowledge to build a house. Whether it's building a mud house or straw hut people imagined putting all of it together and put it in action. How people designed cars for transportation and made it function properly. Engineers are creative and imaginative to come up with such intricate designs and models. Even everyday objects were imagined and made to help you in everyday life. Whether it's a juicer to a wrench, people imagined these things to serve a purpose. How biomechanics creates prosthetic arms and legs to help the disabled to move again. Theses things all started as thought to help society and now are a vital part in today society. Imagination is what led man kind to create items to help us in everyday life.

Music is an form of art where people express their emotions through song. Instruments were imagined for the sole purpose to create art. Then playing the instrument led to more creative thinking, then songs were imagined and instruments added to that. Songs are written with heart and they express the artists' emotions. They are imagined and written down, sometimes using metaphors to express their emotions. People say that they can say things through music that they couldn't say with words. Being able to imagine such meaningful songs that leave a such an impact on the listener is incredible. Music speaks to people in a way words can't and the artist that make them are imaginative people.

Imagination led these artist to produce such songs and music. Painting is an other form of imaginative art. These artist express themselves by using strokes of paint to produce vibrant works of art. Even though a painting is silent people speak through them to show such meaningful works of art. Artists imagine what they want to paint and execute and you can see such a passion in their works of art. Imagination inspires artist to create outstanding pieces of art.

Imagination also expresses itself in the way we dress and life style. For the most part we choose the way we dress,where we work and what we do. When not in uniform or work clothes we choose how we dress. We imagine ourselves a certain way and choose to expresses ourselves that way. Our hair and how we choose to style it also reflects our personality. Whether it's colored,straight,curly or even no hair at all. We also imagine what we want in our lives and choose to study for that career. Our hobbies and interest also show what kind of person you are. How you spend your free time is how you reflect yourself. Our appearance and hobbies are a self reflection of our imagination and who you are. Imagination makes you who you are, and that's what makes everyone a different person.

Imagination might not seem important but it's what allows people to create stories, construct buildings, create items,produce music,to make art and makes you. We need imagination even more than we need knowledge. Without imagination there wouldn't be a way to put our knowledge to use. Imagination is the fuel of the world, it's what keeps everything going. It may seem insignificant at first but imagination is so such more. Without imagination no advancements would be made. We need imagination to do almost everything life. Imagination is what makes us human. Imagination over mind.

Author Ralph Waldo Emerson ""Unless you try to do something, beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"". One thing that is really important in life is School because is the second place that we learn about how we can be respectful, responsible, honest and education. The second thing is Work- Independent because when we are always with our family is simple because we don't know how is the reality in the life. We were dependent but work include be prepare to have new experiences in our personal life and we are prepare to the future. The third thing is Life Cycle when we are baby, kids, teenagers, adults and older.

The first is School (experiences) In our life school is important because teachers educate we and we learn of them about the classes like english when we travel to any country that speak this language we need to learn by process every day inside and outside the class because we improve with new topics like verbs, punctuation marks in school porcess. Teachers teach good values in our life like integrity, respectful, honest, responsible, service. For example, when we start to study we don't know how to write, read, paint, speak. They teach we everything like our parents at home. We decide when we grow up if we want graduate from the school,those values efforts, dedication, knowledge, good skills and new opportunities if we do everything correct inside and outside the school because we can't stop growing the opportunites that we can have is only one time in the life.

Education is very important now in the present because if we go to school we are professionals and we can have good choices. Second is Work being independent in the life our parents work all the time because they want that we can have a good life, but when we go to work is interesting for example when we continue going to the school our parents can't give money all the time and we think like adults being independent, finding a job and learn about the life not is simple and is hard at the same time. Our future dependent if we want to think like adults or teenagers. We can be master helping other people that need our help those people will grateful with we because if we try to help each other we know everything from life experiences, when we go to school they pay better with a diploma from High School, College or University.

Finally is Life Cycle when we are babies our parents teach we every process for example how to go to the restroom, brush our tooth, take a shower, speak, walk, eat for example when is the time for go to the dinning room. The time when we need go to sleep is relly important learn every little thing that our parents teach we when we are baby. We discovere a new stair that already we can be mastered. Kids for example after when we were baby in a simple thing we discovered new things, but being kids we continue in a easy way the life like speak, walk, eat, sleep, change our clothe not is difficult because we learn in the past, we try to do something beyond that we don't know before. Teenagers when we think that the life is hard going to the school, work, family, not is easy because is more responsability, efforts being stronger and continue doing those things is very different from the past. Adults is more difficult when we were baby, kids and teenagers because adults are charge of the family, work, pay, education,

responsabilitys in the job and home. Adults are dependent because they learn the good things from the past for example when teenager want permission for go to any party adults really need to know what person is, where is from, the personality and who is her/his family,

in any moment like that is really difficult to say yes or no. Adults are important in the society because they are master and grow from the Life Cycle. Older like grandmother and father they already know that grow not is easy but they did every step in a good form going the school, work - independent. Old people in sometimes need help from younger people like the family can be sister, brother, son, wife and daughter because they are tired and need space to relax like going to the park sharing with his/her family and friends. In this last thing if we try something different we can have a positive life.

In conclusion:

We can try being a better person in our life because every step is very important maybe in sometimes life is hard but if we learn in a correctly form everything like going to the school is a new experience, work - independent teach we being stronger and not be afraid, life cycle is the process from every step when we were baby, kids, teenagers, adultd and older. We grow every moment that can be easy or difficult. We need to be dependent to grow up, master everything helping other people in the world. I agree with the author because I know if we stop growing is very impossible to have new experiences in our life. Unless we try to do something different and intersting in our life we can a better chance to do good things can be in the present or in the future, for the new generation that can have good opportunities in school, job and with the society.

72C0B0B91BFC,"There are so many things that can make good deed too someone with a good attitude even you can make yourself happy, But sometimes its hard to keep a good attitude while its a difficult time. I myself have witnessed someone with a good attitude it was my good old friend he was having a good attitude all day,But than someone in his family passed away he was really sad about it. Than his attitude was going bad I tired to make his day get better to go and get ice cream but than he was up for it so I was in a good attitude so was he so we were happy, But than his mom got really sick and the doctors said that she might not make it and than he shaded tears and than his day was just going horrible. So much was going on with his family like his mom is so sick she can barley move she was taken to the hospital because she had a high fever of 103. The day they took her to the hospital has got a heart attack at the night she was there and when she was there for a few days and than they brought her back home and that same night she got a heart attack again and my friends dad just said she can't leave the hospital or she might die if we take her back a few weeks passed and his mom recovered and now they are a happy family.

I have witnessed my family member have a good attitude even during a difficult time. One of my family members were going though depression but no one else knew because everyday he always looked happy there was always a smile on his face when someone saw him there was not a time he looked upset or sad but just happy all the time. No one knew what he was going through they didnt know he was getting bullied,failing his classes and last of all no friends he thought he had no one and he kept telling himself he was alone. Everyone thought he was mad at something little like him not getting a toy or something because he was just a 10yr boy the rest of the family thought he was just a regular little kid running around all over the place laughing at everything and even cry at little stuff, but no he did nun of that all he did was just stay in his room lights turned off and the door was shut and locked. But than one day he forgot to lock his room and than I walked in and he was just crying and kept saying ""I got nobody I got nobody"" and than i made him feel better and then we put him in counseling for a few months and he started getting better and better while time went on.

When you have a good attitude it can make your day be good and you'll be positive with everything. Even in a bad times like for example if a family member or a friend is sick you can make there day by getting them there favorite food or snack that can get them in a good attitude with you because they may be a little grumpy while there sick.

While your in a good attitude you'll feel like you accomplish something for today and while other people will try to take you down you mind and your feeling will be strong and you won't be able to be in a bad attitude. Most people would want to be be in a good attitude but others are the world should just be happy and not always mad at something. I wish everyone in the world can be happy and something they did and not be mad at everything like sometimes when you play sports when you lose its a little upsetting at first but than you lose your attitude get stronger and you start being your self way more.

I witnessed another of my friends trying to keep a good attitude his attitude was getting stronger and better because he played a lot of soccer but than his dad kept taking it to seriously. My friend was so tired that he wanted to take a break but his dad didnt let him he kept telling him get up lets go play everyday and on weekend his dad woke him up at 5 in the morning to go play soccer. Than on Monday when he got back to school he started getting eye bags under his eyes and than he was tired of it and went o his dad and i said '' Im tired of soccer and i give up''. His dad looked so shocked and upset that he left him speechless and than he said fine when you grow up you are not going to become a famous soccer player. My friend still played soccer but he only played when he wanted to and he still was really good at soccer that I bet you he is better than me.

One time my friend and I were in a good attitude right we were playing at the park and than my friend jumped off the slid and than he broke his arm is was so nasty His bone was popping out he was crying and yelling and Ididnt know what to do and i called his partents they came so fast and than they took him to the hospetil and I was sad because I felt like it was all my fault and than his partents cheered me up and they said ''its not yout fault its okay its just a common mistake and a few weeks later his arm got better his arm was in a case so he was good and I was the first one that sighned it so i was happy about that and than we were both happy we got ice cream and we had a sleepover and the rest of the day was good.",2.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0250094,2.8982632,3.2470193,3.1009653,2.9113345,2.8175142,3.127014,3.873898,3.9084108,4.0408983,3.7366672,3.5771778,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,1025,21,0.3073170731707317,48.80952380952381,12,12,"{'nun', 'mom', 'bullied', 'sleepover', '5', '103', 'upsetting', 'soccer', 'speechless', 'grumpy', 'cheered', 'wo'}"
7797541CF0A6,"The succes is what people really want all the time, but it is not easy at all. Sometimes we have to pass throught dificults situationt to get to the sucess. Each person want to be succesful in life, but to get what we really want, we have to be positive with the head up. We dont have to put ourselves in an unconfortable situation because it won't help us to get the succes that we want. It just going to help us to go through the way of failure. Not all the time going to be easy. We must have to fail a lot of time, it help us to see what we are doing wrong, and what we have to change to get what we want. We just have to keep going with enthusiasm and believe in ourselves. The sucess help to the people to be someone in life.

We can see in our everyday how hard is life, and how we have to strive ourselves to get the sucess, but we can see that there are obstacles and we have to know how to pass through it. Life is hard, but nothing is imposible if we have already planned what we want. Sometimes we dont get the result on what we have been worked. But nothing can be hard at all, we have to know that all is posible, we dont have to take it as imposible. One example that we can see in our everday are the students in the university. Not all of them have the support of the family to cover the cost to pay the the clas in the university. Some of them have to work to get the money and pay their study. Some of them have to fail because it's not easy to do at lot of things at the same time, but we can see that they keep going through it, doesn't matter what. To get the sucess we have to work and just focuss on what we want. At the end we can see the result. We must have to fail a lot of time, but we have to have in mind that we can do it. The people who graduate, at the end they remember how hard it was. But they believed in theirselves and also keeped their head up with enthusiasm, and learned of each mistake that they had done in the way to the sucess.

Other example can be the student from other country in high school, at the end of each year the student have to do a test of each subjet they have. But is not easy fo them because not all of them speak english, they have to learn a lot and out themselves in a hard situation to do it. They have to effort a lot themselves, some of them have to fail like three time to pass the test. But they know that nothing is imposible if they believe in themselves. They know that they have to take tests to graduate, we can see the hispanic student in Generic_School, they have to take the ESOL test each year but they have to study a lot because their first language that they know is spanish, and they just have been in this country in a little while. For some of them the situation is hard, but at the end we can see them in their way to graduate and how proud they are of themselves because it's not easy to learn english.

Also, we can see the organizations that want to help to the people who doesn't have nothing, they have to do a lot of thing and have to be prepare because no one know if they gonna get what they want. The goverment and other institutions have to aprove the organization and one of the best examples is Shakira and her fundation ''Pies Descalso"", she wants to help to the children with the eduation, and alimentation. She had to do a concert to get the money to start with her fundation, she has been in hard situation but she always believed in herself. We can see today how she had changed the life of millions of children around the world, how bennefitted with education and alimentation they are. child from poor families are now someone in life, some of them are in the university. All can be hard but never imposible. She accomplish her dream, doesn't matter what. In her way, were obstacle and difficults things. But she didn't give up because of that.

People have to know that doesn't matter what they can achive what they really want and keep going in their way to the sucess. Nothing in life going to be easy but they have to know that dreams can come true. They must have to fail a lot of time in the persuit of sucess. But they have to know that nothing going to be in the way they want but they can keep going until they can achive their purpose. Doesn't mattter how many time they have to fail, if they want to be someone in life they have to know that the way have a lot of surprices but thay have to have in their mind that nothing is imposible if they see that situation in that way. We all can be succesful in life, we just have to belive in ourselves and keep in mind that no one can make us feel less than them, we all are equal, we all have dreams and we all can achieve what they want in life to be successful.

244973AE9715,"Many people are kind and do parts in helping others , what they don't know is , the act of kindness either received from or given to someone has a big impact no matter how small or big . Reasons an act of kindness can really benefit someone are , the person might have a better day just because of your kindness , the person might learn from your act of kindness and lastly , a good act of kindness can come back to you from the person who you helped .

The first reason of how kindness can impact a person is , the person whom you helped might have had a bad day or , you never know what someone is going through , they could have a hard life and are hiding it . The person who received the act of kindness might have bad a bad day or life , your kindness could have made that person feel so much better and worthy. Some people don't often receive kindness , you might have put a big smile on their face or , made their day much better . You can be seen as a person with good characters and manners , people can always depend on you if you are a kind person and do a lot to help make someone feel better with words or actions everyday , most people would appreciate you if you did almost anything to help them or make them smile because again , you never know what someone is going through . For example , I partnered up with a girl in our math class , she was crying for some reason and nobody wanted to be her partner , when I told her if she can be my partner , she said yes and sounded really happy when I said . I , of course told her what was wrong , she told me she was going through a lot at home and nobody wanted to be her friend in school , I was devastated to hear that . I told her she can be my friend and for the rest of the day she smiled and laughed .

The second reason any act of kindness , big or small , can impact a person is , the person receiving the kindness can learn from you and make themselves a better character too , you can influence a person with how you act , if you act kind and generous and , make good choices , someone is gonna learn from your words and actions . Same with if your a person who is just rude and makes bad decisions , someone else , will learn from your actions . Many people tend to learn from people in their environment , especially young people , so if a young person sees you offering a kind act of helping to either them or someone else , they can learn from your actions and see you as a big role model , people should always make good decisions for many reasons one being that young people can benefit from your choices and will always look up to you for being the person to guide them through life , many people make bad decisions around children but if you do an act of kindness , to them or someone else , young kids will automatically learn from you . For example , one day me and my little sister were in the park , playing with our friends , we saw an old lady all of a sudden drop her apples , I immediately went to the side walk and helped the lady , I picked up the apples and put them in a safe and clean bag . The old lady thanked me and told me , ""you're well mannered , thank you for your help , I appreciate it , may god bless you"" , I smiled and said ""your very welcome"" . The next day as I was going to the bus stop , to pick my little sister up from school , my little sister ran to me and said ""I sat next to this new girl in our school who was being bullied . I even shared my lunch with her because, she did not have much food at home to bring to school "" . I was delighted to hear her story , I told her why she did that , she responded ""when I saw you helping the old lady yesterday , I realized how nice you were and how happy the lady was , I decided to do something similar "" .

The third reason of how an act of kindness can benefit someone in many ways is , the good act of kindness can come back to you . For example , one day , a girl in our class came late to school , we were in our social studies class , she came and sat down and asked people if she could copy the notes , all of my classmates shouted ""NO"" .

I went up to her and gave her my notes . She was happy and said thank you , when she finished copying my notes , I went to my seat . About a week later , we were having a contest in our school , whoever won would receive a prize . I sadly did not have any knowledge of the topic for the contest . The next day , I partnered up with the girl who copied my notes , I told her about how I wanted to win the contest . She looked happy and told me she knew all about the topic , she said she could help me and I replied with , ""I would appreciate it so much "" . I went to her house after school and taught me all about the animal , we needed to have certain knowledge of the animal to do the contest in our school . The next day , I did the project and the next day ,I winned .I thanked the girl .

In conclusion , any act of kindness can benefit a person , you might make them smile , make them learn , or , the act will come back to you.

83C48C5697AE,"Living in a place with frequentely hihgest demand to provide my best, is one the must important achievement. I agree with Emerson statement because with the individuality we can reach all our goals.

It is to important for me to recognize that i have to get my goals with effort. Because this help to provide, work hard, competition, and bocome the best .Individuality is a good factor to trust in my self to be the best because help us to look for option that help our lifes

.Working by my self make me work hard. when a person work by his own company he try to do a great work fixing everything it is the such as work alone, if you work alone yo going to do a perfect job to impresione others labors .For example, when i work without partner, i try to do a great gob to be one on the best workers. When i do my own work i feel excite cause, i could receive an award for be a good producer. everybody want to be award for their job so everrybody wish a reward. But to be award we have to hsave capacity in the jobs Many person due the same thing like me cause doing my the own work provide a big result. So working by my self make an emotion to work hard and to increase the amoung. Consequently to do a individual work make a good results. Doing own projects workers show more production In the factory and result good Therefore this help to get alot resources by workers.

Competiton is a ways to decrease the teamwork. individual competition is a big example of overcome. Examples could be when a person start to work in his job and start to recieve more money because the person is doing a great work ,this make that others poerson get mad so in the factory start the competition cause everyone want to recieve more money and they thick is unfair be reciving the same amoung of money so they start to argued why the manager give more money to the new guy but the thing is that he has a good specialization in the job. concecuently Many time the work competition provide a good production in the factory so, everyone want to get their goals like a good amount of products also,big accomplishment occur with the worker is trying to find a new way to get more product than other. For example, when a worker finished his assignment could receive free time,this make feel angry other workers so , they are going to try to look for others forms to produce more than the winner because, they want to receive the same reward for the production . To do a good competition the work have to be alone to and with big group people. competition is a good way for individuality work to provide a emotional affect. In many companies the owners look for a way that workers produces a lot and they offer money or free time to the person that make more products .as result, being in a factory with many labors working seperated make a big impact where everyone want to procud the most materials. Therefore,challenge could be a a good idea for separated jobs .

Looking for an accomplishment to become the best. Every one in this life want to have something to be recognize in this world althogh,to be a succefull person we have to work hard. Not matters what tell about us such as critique,bullying ,etc. The only thing that is important for us who we are. So the best thing that could can happens in our life is be a place where frecuently we are demand to do different things. Although with many problem we have to be patience and support all bad things. Because,if we wish to be different than the rest of persons and realize our goals. thought must be working by our selves. Because sometimes nobody is with us to provide help. fighting by my self i could be a big man in the socierity. Currently in the world we have many competition one example can be soccer,almost the majority look in the tv .Soccer is a game where a team have 24 for player. They have to compite who is the leader in the team. So like in the real life the leader is the person that work hard,help the other players .Otherwise, could be a leader in a company, to be the leader of a company ,the leader had to compite with other person that wanted to become a big leader ..Therefore to be a person succesfull have to take individual decision .

Being in a world where have to take decision and concern about goals is the best thing that we can have to show our capacity. Doing my own job make me put effort and dedication. Work in gruop is affect by bet. Being a different person than others. The person that different quality could be someone that can help.

D344D0003B84,"Every person has their own feelings, emotions, and their own talents. But people are thinking that if they that talent or skill, and they can not do that in front of the world or people. As all people has different talent, that they really want to show to people. Before they think about their talent to chance their own world, they will be so nervous that they can't do that. They will be afraid, they will not show that to people that can learn from it. That they can try it on their own life, so they can learn new thing from new people. Over 90% of all people in the world has their own talent or skills because they are being being appreciated that who are they, and by believing on their self that how hard they worked.

To begin with, one way that all people can develop their talent is by being appreciated on their self that who they are, and how they can change the world. For example, one day it was our first day that we came to America, and I even didn't know that much English that I can talk to person. So one year later I learn some English, and I got to 8 grade, by other day we were going to do the student let decision. I really did not talk that much because I was so nervous about it like how I have to talk in front all the teachers, and students. I wanted to try it but I couldn't do that. This evidence shows that, being in different country and not knowing their language is really hard. My mom, and dad was always trying so hard that one day I will be able to speak English. My mom, and dad were always telling me that ""always be appreciated that how you got to this level, and think about hoe you can make different talents that people can see, so they can improve it on their life."" After that day I told to my self "" I always will be able to be appreciated to my self, and by being in this world."" As always that one day I will show my talent to people that I never thought of that one day I will learn English too. clearly, if I wasn't being appreciated to my self, to my teachers, to my family that they were working with me together. I wasn't be able to even write this essay. now even if I am not that much perfect I am happy that I got to that point that I and my family really wanted.

In addition, there is other way that you can show your talent to people by believing in your self that you can get to your goal by working hard as much as you can do it, and as much as possible. So you can see the result of it by your working hard. For Example, my brother Generic_Name, he is in 12 grade, for him it was really hard because he was always worrying about his grades, and he was saying ""how I can get to finish my

12 grade by being a perfect student. He was always wondering about his self, and that how hard will be next year.

One day my mom, and dad told him that ""if you believe in your self, by that time you already got this."" this evidence shows that,

Generic_Name couldn't believe on his self. Generic_Name wanted to know that how he can show his own talent . He was always worked hard to improve in his new talents or skills. Now he got to finish his 12 grade by being successful. By next year he will go to collage. Clearly, if Generic_Name didn't listen to my mom, and dad he wasn't able to finish his 12 grade by showing to all of his teacher that how he improved om his talents.

In conclusion, developing your talent or skill is a different way or different thing that you can bring it into your own life. By being appreciated and believing in your self that change your life, and bringing a smile up on your family face. As always people want to develop new talent to their own life to make them change, different, and happy. Clearly, being in a different country, far from your own family, And you can't see them. It's really hard for everyone especially me with my family. But I got a strong talent that no one can pull me back from it. For bring appreciated to my have that they were working together with me that I can get to this part. Today I realize that how much I improving in own life, in writing, and speaking English. Even if not that much perfect. And like Generic_Name, he believe on his self, and he worked hard that he got to that point. Now he is working hard that he can make this world a better place for his future that is coming up. Clearly, if you want to improve in your own life or in you own talent or skill that is in your heart, and that can show your develop to the people for this world, and it will be applying to your own goals. Always be thankful, be appreciated to your family, teacher that they worked hard for you to learn new things that will persuade you to your new goals. As everyone has a talent to the world, And that way they can change the world too. Always work hard in your life if you want to develop your talent. By improving a skill can make your own place, and your own world beautiful as they can see the result of it at the end.

07A4DAFDE5B7,"Hello, Mr: Principal.

I'm writing to you this letter to inform you about our responses about changing the school manu.

I'm a senior student in your high school. I really want to thank you about approving the idea of chenging the school manu to a new healthier and bigger one. We really appreciate that.

Some of us have a bad experince about the unhealthy food and the schol old manu.

one of them is PROPER_NAME he hate the spicy food and once before he tried it by mistake from the cafeteria, his stomach hurt him and he was throwing up all the day, and all of that because of the un healthy food.

And also I will tell you sir about my own experince, I still remember, when I was a kid I had one of the worst days on my entire life in the middle school when I decided to eat the new spicy wings with the super hot souce, I went to the hospital and I was very sick for a long time in the home.

And all of that because of the unhealthy food such as what our school used to have.

Do you know sir, I used to feel unacceptable in the school, just because the food, just because I can not eat like the rest of the students. and I can not enjoy the food with them.

I have never tried the school food since that day. the only case I could eat the school food is when the cafeteria have some kinds of soap, and some kind of the none spaicy food. And there is a lot of students have the same case of me, we all are sharing our healthy lunch together, you might before have seen us in the cafeteria while we are setting as a circle.

But by your decision, there are more than a hundred of student will turn back to eat in the school cafeteria.

We all will be enjoying the new cafeteria manu.

Especially because I heard that will be a different types of milk and different type chicken and also I heard from the new chef that you brought him from one of the biggest holtes in Virginia, he told me we will have a few types of salmon fish and others fish types.

In my opinion changing the school cafeteria manu was great idea to begin to keep your student health safe, especially your freshman and salphamore students.

I know what i'm telling you about the salphamore and the freshmens student very well, because I have my youngest brother his name is Generic_Name, he is addicted to the unhealthy food with the all of this food types, like the fast food. he could eat only the fast food in his life and he would be happy, but his body would not like that. Acctually his body begun to hurt him from now, because he been so fat and he could not move or do ant effort. he eats only the fast food which is the only unhealthy food in the world. he has a problems in his body, his body hurt him because he does not eat a vegetables and he does not has ant vetimans in his body, his body is fery big but is's very weak.and that is what the un healthy food does in our boodies. that is what you sir, saved us from and saved the next students from it. absotutly the healthy food a lot cheper than the unhealthy food. also one of the good thing is the teacher also would like to eat and try the new healthy food.

one of the good thing and actually it's the best thing ever is that healthy food will give the student more power than the un healthy food, and also the healthy food will make them paying more attention to the classes and to what the teachers are saying.

the new healthy food will be very good thing. I wish if you sir would took this decision 3 years ago, just whaen I was a freshman or when I was a salphamore that would be great if that happend. I can not stop Imagine if that happen I was going to be playing Gym all the summer and in the winter I'm was going to have PE class. That was going to be very good. I wish if that happend before.

But htat's fine I still can enjoy the rest of this year with eating a just healthy food from our cafeteria from this new chef. I heard he will add a new typers of food from other countries like France and Egypt and Spain, and Ethiopia also. yeah that is how the school lunch should be like.

Do you know Mr: principle that there are about 20 Muslim student in this school who does not eat the old manu food like the bacon and Pig.

Do you know Mr: Principal, in our school there are about 50 student or more than that who are vegan, this students used to feel very bad about the old school manu because they could ot eat any food from the cafeteria for all the time they had in the school. But from now and over these students are very happy about your decision. and also the Muslims students now they are happy because they can eat the vegan food and a least they can eat the chicken and the others food.

Actually I know there are a lot of student will arguement with you about your decision. but they still young to understand that, they still too young to look for thier health and the healthy food and the unhealthy food.

But, acctualy they will appreciate that very well when they became adults.

Mr: the principale thank you, thank you about looking for our health. thank you for being acceptable for the new ideas.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.9259605,2.728636,3.1007123,2.8682394,2.6268835,2.6588173,3.474057,3.0890598,3.7428138,3.194505,3.2611408,2.9445167,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,996,44,0.3052208835341365,22.63636363636364,34,14,"{'unacceptable', 'healthier', 'ethiopia', '3', 'spicy', 'approving', 'addicted', '20', 'pe', '50', 'gym', 'vegan', 'salmon', 'eats'}"
39E0A362CF29,"The Generation of today they all want success instead of failure,for success to occur we have to fight for it,success does not come by itself every single human have to built,A success live without losing the enthusiasm,but the problem of today, is that people usually likes to give up things. Although, some say that success does not consist of going from failure to failure actually, it does consist of going from failure to failure,one reason is,because we are getting stronger. At some point we fail in something,for my own perspective it is like a new opportunity for us,so we can learn from our mistake. In general all the people at some point can commit an error,but the problem here is not the mistake committed, the problem is that people start losing the willing to learn,and willing to be better. there is not even one perfect human, who does not fail in anything. Another reason is because you can meet your level. It is really important for us to know our capacity. I am sure that our brain is not limited we put limit in our lives we all have the ability to get things done, it doesn't matter the situation or the problem. There always have been solutions for every single situation,for all the people who does not give up.

Those who believe, that success does not consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm have their reasons. They believe that failure does not give a good outcome to be re joy of;They seem failure like a pain hurting people making them feel really bad, and it makes them not to keep trying. They also think that failure make them doubt themselves,and that is not true my argument is not to give up so easily. They have to try until they get it done,and clearly,but nevertheless they regret it.

In my point of view, I believe that when failure occur we get stronger. An example of this would be my friend Generic_Name: 20 years old, a white man,black eyes, and black hair. He wanted to go to college, to study electricity, but his finance was slow,so decided to learn it without going to college. I knew right away that he will be challenged to make his way thought,so he start practicing looking tutorials, how to fix things, how to change a lamp, all that kind of stuff,but my surprise was when the time pass he apply for a electricity company. I said to him

! are you serious ! don't tell me that you already know electricity. He got a moment of silence... and respond yes, i make my own way he start explaining me all the difficulties part that he was on. He said that at some point he wanted to just forget that,but something inside of him wanted to keep trying. Of course the people were saying no you cant do it in a funny way,but he did not listened to the people. Moreover he wanted to keep going. He knew that it was something hard to become an electrician,but not impossible. Today Generic_Name is a really good electrician. He did not only learned electricity. He also learned how to paint houses. This is a proof that we cannot give things up only because it seem hard. It is not based on your finance. Some people have a low economy,but still there is not wall that can stop the willing to do something. It only required a personal character and volunteer. What might happened if Generic_Name loss the enthusiasm he probably will be putting less importance on him.

I also think that when failure occur frequently, we will know and meet our level our own capacity, like what are we made of. A prove of this can be my sister in law. She was on high school senior year. She had some problem in her algebra 2 class at the beginning she did not understood anything. She was in every single class,but the problem was that her grades in algebra were critical,so she talked with her boyfriend Generic_Name which is my brother. She was saying that she did not wanted to go to her algebra 2 class. Not anymore,because it was too hard she feel less intelligent and she wanted not to keep trying. My brother respond, I think that you are just starting in the way that you have not try like I would like you to try, if you doubt yourself that is a problem,because I can see a really smart person right in front of me. Believe in yourself and try again after that, she decided to give everything or nothing, so she was studying really hard, asking a lot of questions to the teacher, with that hunger to learn, and be the best in her Algebra class. Even though her classmates were ironic. Her eyes were not on them. In addition she learned a lot at the beginning she was below of her classmates, more often she was the Hornet in her class with a reward for trying super hard, and get things done on time. Image what might occurred if my sister in law give up, so easily of course she will fail the class in all quarters and have that tone of loser on her.

In conclusion, when failure comes don't let it the opportunity to take over you,because you will be thinking of yourself bad things. If you are having hard times and you can't see things clear, just ask these question to yourself Do i am doing enough for it or i am just starting?. every single of us have a big ability there no exceptions. there is people who really know what they want,and fight for it and there is people who easily give things up. We should be those kind of people who does not look for their goals and dream who are sitting down expecting how other people naturally reach to their dreams.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.1550856,2.9347787,3.3238487,3.0733995,2.7636673,2.9372053,3.9044583,3.8294554,3.882887,3.8684514,3.601385,3.8591657,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,1031,51,0.3501454898157129,20.215686274509803,3,11,"{'tutorials', 're', 'algebra', 'hornet', 'electrician', '20', 'hurting', 'boyfriend', 'loser', 'cant', '2'}"
AB9527C4A312,"Technology have the limitation of human contract is due to use of technology had positive or negative effects on peoples's lives. Humans use the technology for some different's things,on this times technology is almost everywhere. If the technology did not exist we cant had more opportunities for learned more things for our life. Also,the people don't need to see face to face for had a conversation, because the technology are very advance that if you only cant had a phone you can communicate for text with people in other continents or countries. technology make all more easy than can be. i think that the technology can be affect in a positive way .For that a have some examples:

Technology is used for many things on humans life that make that the technology had a positive effect. For example,for some people the technology is their work they don't need to ask to nobody if they had a question about something ,if they did not had technology they can work and they can had money for live. Also,on the schools teachers and students need to use the technology,most of the time the students do their works on computers and they need to turned in by way of

Internet and if they had a question about something they can found on internet,on the schools is very important the technology they use for many things,on the schools of united states students and teachers use to do their works like 50% of technology they use more the technology for found information and they don't use a lot of books .In other way one part of the most people that use the technology is the doctors. They had a lot of technology devices,they use that for help people,the most part are for do operations that help them to safe more life than the pass times they now trust more on the technology that the books. However technology is use a lot on fabrics and that make that the people don't work hard like on fabrics that need to packed the technology is the that make more the work than the people.

Humans can use technology to do good or bad things. For example,with the time the people begin to learned little by little on how can they use the technology. The most part of people use the technology to do good things,like for their works like secretaries,teachers,doctors,and another works that use technology to communicate or safe things .Other people use the technology for teach to the children,in the Latin countries some parents begin to call the technology the new babysitter, for the reason that the technology like the phone, tablets , etc and more things like them are one of the ways more easy for distracting the children when their moms need to do or make somethings they use the technology and they don't need to other persons be with your children for distracting .Other people don't had good things on how can they use the technology and they learned how use however they use to defraud or search people on their social media they communicate a lot with the people. Some times they use to sequester people or to rob other peoples bank accounts. In some times is a lot of cases where the old people treated of fraud the children between the technology,like the socials media or online games they use to communicate in a bad way .In this case a lot of people death,in other are to use the technology on a bad way is when people want to be a hacker and they don't care to who they go to steal their accounts, in most of the case they steal banks accounts and use a lot of technology for that . that make me thing that if we had more opportunities to use the technology not all people think on good ways to use.

Technology can change the way of people live and think. for example. On one part the technology can do that the people feel safety of how their live in a good way on their house because the technology is more advanced and their create many things for people can be safe. Also, the technology make that the people that like to express on public can had a work in the social medias and show the their like to do like the youtubers they dont know who are washing then but they always talk like their know who see. the technology change the form of think of the old people because their in the pass time they need to write letters but now they can send a text or do a video call they dont need to be face to face . the limitation of the communications it is okay if you don see the person for talk. and if you are with your friends on one online game you need to had communication with him and you can talk face to face because he live in the other part of the world you can talk between the technology that make that the technology had a positive effect on the limitation.

Conclusion, some times the limitation of the human contact had a negative effect. For example, when you are in your work you need to have communication with your companion of work because you need to had a good relation with him. Also,if you are in a relationship with someone you can't communicate with him or her only for text you need to talk with your partner for had a good contact each other. However if you see the things for other way like when you are in the schools you need to found a answer and you do trust on that you classmate said you can discuss with other people by technology or search for that. on the conclusion for all my examples i think that no matter what if we had or not had human contact because both had positives an negatives effects. sometimes humans prefer technology more than books for search something because that are Lacy and don't want to read and the technology no always give to us good answers. But in limitation i think we need to had more human communication that technology communication.",2.5,2.5,3.5,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.6952472,2.4769754,2.9274182,2.6105719,2.3015127,2.5022278,3.0348065,2.8061001,3.4194376,2.4015791,2.080678,2.999147,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,1076,30,0.2351301115241635,35.86666666666667,7,18,"{'defraud', 'negatives', 'classmate', 'tablets', 'moms', 'video', 'babysitter', 'positives', '50', 'internet', 'online', 'cant', 'sequester', 'hacker', 'medias', 'somethings', 'socials', 'distracting'}"
CC8C5C963660,"A study found that 87% of students that participate in extracurricular activities become more involved at school. Extracurricular activities are fun you once you let yourself try something new. Most kids judge something before trying it, but if they try it might be worth it. Most people that do extracurricular have a more happier time in school because of its positive effects. I agree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students can make new friends, become more productive, and finding a passion for something new.

One reason, I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because you can make new friends. When I was kindergarten there was a healthy kids club and I was a shy kid at the time. So my parents thought it would be the best for me to join the club. I was very against but still went to the club. My neighbor joined the club too so we could be together at least. When my neighbor and I came to the first healthy kids club meeting, and we were separated into different groups. A teacher called my name to leave the room with a bunch of kids in my grade that I didn't know. After we got into the room people started talking and making new friends. This one girl named Generic_Name came up to me and we started talking. After becoming friends with her, the club wasn't that bad. Generic_Name and I started to sit by each other at lunch, and played together at recesses. We are still friends together to this very day. Another example is when my neighbor started to learn baseball. As he grew up no one else in the neighborhood knew how to play baseball. He always wished he had someone to play with. Once he got into middle school he heard they were having tryouts for the baseball team. So he decided to try out for the baseball team. He made the team. He started having more friends come over to his house. He even made friends in higher grades then him. He would always being playing baseball or out having fun with his new friends. I could tell he became a more happier person, and that he has now found people he can relate to and overall have fun with too. So this is why I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because you can make new friends.

Furthermore, I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students become more productive. My cousin she decided to join volleyball team her freshman year. She thought it would be fun to join. She started to focus too much on volleyball. Her grades started slipping and she was told she couldn't play any volleyball games till her grades were up. She had to stay up late nights to complete extra work that would raise her grades. She thought to herself, if she went back to the volleyball team she would have to find a balance to make sure volleyball doesn't take over her whole life. She got her grades back on track and she was allowed to play in games again. She started getting used to her new schedule to balance volleyball, and school. My next example is when my uncle was in high school, he joined an after school club for mechanics. My uncle wasn't a very good child growing up. He was always skipping classes, and never show up to class. Soon he joined a mechanics club with his friends. He instantly fell in love with it. He started showing up for school, and teachers started to see him be more productive. He so after choose his job as a mechanic, and he started to save money to have his own mechanic shop. He soon went to college to learn more about mechanics. He started working in a mechanic shop to learn the experiences of working and owning a shop. He then started his own successful company. Without extracurricular to change his attitude about school, he wouldn't be where he is today. These are a few reasons why I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students become more productive.

Therefore, I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students can find a passion for something new. When I first joined band I didn't know what instrument I would be playing. I started to play the saxophone and became good at it. Once I started to show my teacher, he offered to put me in honor band and that I would need to stay after school to join it. I started to get new songs for honor band that challenged me. I knew when I grew up I wanted to play saxophone. I'm in middle school and I couldn't get into band this year due to my honor classes. This year I have missed playing the saxophone because its my passion. I have decided next year to do less honor classes to see if I can get back into band and get to do my passion again. My second example is about my closest cousin. She joined her after school baking classes. She started baking cakes for family events and special occasions. She finally found out when she was older she wanted to become a baker. She is now working in at a bakery nearby my house. She is always baking and learning new techniques to improve her baking skills. This year she will be graduating high school early and going to culinary school. She never knew what her passion was going to be and without extracurricular she would have never known. These are my reasons why I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students can find a passion for something new.

Students making new friends, people become more productive, and find a passion for something new are reasons why I agree that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activities. Without trying extracurricular people might never know the importance of trying something new. Overall this is why I believe extracurricular can change your life.

Writing SOL

Where is one place you would like to visit?

I would like to visit Florida because they have really nice weather.

Florida is something special to me because I have family in Florida.

The place I would visit is my grandfather grave because my grandfather had died last year

To, begin The reason why I picked Florida is because I have really nice, cool family in Florida.

My grandfather had dies last year after he had fell and hit his head on the ground.

He is special to me because if it was'nt for him I would not be playing soccer right now.

Every time I score a goal i always do a celebration for him.

I have something valuable of his and that is the gold chain that I got on now that he gave me and I had never took the chain ever since he gave it to me.

I will take off this chain the day I die.

I had promised him that I will love soccer forever and go to college to play soccer.

The college that I'm going to is Generic_School.

The reason why I would like to go to this college is because I had went there for a scholarship and I had got the scholarship and they said that I am really good for my age.

Here go some tips if your not good at soccer you should go outside and practice makes perfect.

If your not good at it you should try I mean it is really not a hard sport if you think about it.

If someone say that you suck let them keep on telling you that for me I will take that as motivation.

The reason why I love soccer so much is because of my grandfather he loved soccer just like me.

Everytime I had went to Florida to go visit family me and my grandfather we would always watch soccer games and tell me some formation to play when I grow up.

The favorite things that my grandfather love to do was drawing, playing soccer and teach me some new moves.

Every morning we would wake up he will always take me and my brother to waffle house and we would tell some stories to me and my brother about what he did when he was growing up.

When he had fell and went to the hospital I was not but when my mom face time my aunt he found out that we could not move body shoulders down and then he had to get some brain surgies and all that then the week after all that he had died and we face timed my aunt and he prayed on the phone and we all was crying.

I had a soccer game the day after he died and I had scored 6 goals and every time I had scored I had always kissed my hand and point it up to the sky.

After the game I was crying because I was proud of my self that I played a game with all that stress over my shoulders and I said to my self I did that for my grandfather.

Then right after the game my mom had came to me and started crying because I told her that I was going to score 6 goals just for my grandfather and I did what I said I was going to do.

That night I was praying and telling my grandfather that I had scored 6 goals just for him and I was saying to my head that I was going to do that more often.

My next soccer game I had scored 5 goals but every time I go on the pitch I had always kissed my chain and touched the ground and point at the sky and I still do that today.

My soccer game in 2 more weeks and I am going to do what I need to do to take my team to the championship and I will play all my soccer games just for my grandfather.

All the soccer games I play they will always be for my grandfather and he will never forget that and if I have to do anything just to get some goals I will then just for him.

When I was in Florida my grandfather had bought me a soccer poster and a soccer jersey of my favorite soccer player.

He had got a jersey customize for that say my last name and my favorite which is number 7 and that is my favorite soccer player number to.

When I was little he had always send me some of his drawing and like always write a little back that say I will always love u miyo and miyo mean son.

When I was 10 years old he came down here to Virginia and he was visiting and he will always wake up at 4 o clock in the morning to go fora bike ride and when he came back he had always fix breakfast for us.

In the afternoon he will always 1 v 1 me or my brother in soccer for some money like 10 dollars but that is if we beat him do.

This why I play soccer just because of him.

Like when I get frustrated in the soccer game I will always take a deep breath and think about my grandfather and that is what always calm me down when I get frustrated.

He had always tell me if someone is talking trash always smile because that dont talk the most is the most strong ones in the game and I always tell them look at the score board.

Here go the reason why I would like to go to Florida:

Family and my grandfather grave.

I would like to go to Generic_City studios.

Go to the beach and get some nice weather.

In conclusion, Where is one place you will like to visit?

I would like to visit Florida because Florida have nice weather.

Florida is something special to me because I have family down in Florida.

The place I would like to visit is my grandfather grave. Another place I would like to visit is Generic_City studios because like your like in a movie because there are people that are dressed up as some characters.

Another place I would like to visit is the indoor soccer field and play some soccer there with some family and maybe some new friends if I meet some there.

04ACA7EB3994,"No,I dont think students should attend online classes from home. Because online classes might be sometimes harder for them to understand and to get help. It is always better to take classes in the person so students can learn better and get more experience and they can easily get help from the teachers whenever they want to. Online classes make people lazy and dont went them to do anything. They should get experience of going to school so they can learn more better. In my opinion in person classes are way better than the online classes. And it help students to be on time always.

Students should take the classes in person so they can attend school daily and get more active. It is totally different experience by taking classes online or in person beacuse sometimes its hard to understand from the online classes and students cant get it. Online classes are good for the students who need to graduate early and they cant have more in person classes so they can take the classes online and graduate on time. online classes make students lazy and dont they dont do it on time and they get lazy by staying at home. Online classes might be harder sometimes than the in person classes. Some people are used to online classes because they feel they are more easier for them. online classes are good for students who want to complete their all the required credits. Some people dont get time to do the online classes beacuse they have to go to work and they cant able to finish everything on time. They put more effort by going to school and sometimes they just dont feel like doing to online class. Online classes are good for those who wants to complete there courses early. Students should attend school so they learn more better. Sometimes online classes might be pressure for some students because its alot of them to do it and it depends on them whenever they want to do it and they should finish before the end of the school year and itmight be more stressful for them to complete everything soon. They should try there best to attened school beacuse it is more better than doing the online classes.

Online classes make some people lazy and they dont get experience of going to school. They should go to school and attend the classes so they can do all there work in class and get help from teachers whenever they feel difficulty beacuse getting help from online classes are harder it is a bit harder to get help from internet because some people dont understand them and it is more easier when they get help in person and they can understand everything easily and ask questions whenever they would like to. While,Some people might say yes it is better to attend online classes rather than going to school because they have to work in the morning and they dont get time to come to attend in person classes because they dont feel like going to attened them so they attend them at home. Students dont get much things in online classes and the feel difficulty sometimes and its hard for them to get some help from someone. Becasue if they go to in school classes they can get more help and they can get help for them to go to college. They can ask their counselour about how to apply for the colleges they want to get admission. They can get know whats going on in school and they can attend many activites in school and take some electives classes so they can learn more. Some people just want to take the classes online becasue they dont have the time to go to school.

Some students attend both online and in person classes beacuse they cant get enough classes at school in a year and they want to graduate on time so they take online classes so they can finish everything on time. It is little harder to attend both at a time beacuse they had to go to work too and they dont get time to do online classes. One of my friend jose he had done the same. He had to graduate on the same year but he was missing one class and he was not able to graduate on the same year so he went to his conseolur and he asked him what can he do to graduate on the same year so she gave him the idea for the online class and he started doing it. He felt it little harder but he was able to finish on time and he was able to graduate on time. Some students are always late on doing on online classes because they dont have enought time to do it If students get to in schools they get to know more about school and be more responsibility and they can get more education so they dont feel difficulty when they go to college they should always have experience of high school so they dont have any problem in college later on. And students put more effort in class because they have to get good grades so they can get good GPA and easily get admission in the college they want to. Online classes are sometimes harder depends on what class are they taking. Maths class might be harder to do in online classes beacuse you always need someone to help you because you might have so many questions and it will be harder to do maths in computer.

In conclusion,I would say it is better to take classes in school so students can learn more better and its more easier for them. In person classes are always better and students can get more help and understand better. Students can take part in activites. Students get more active by coming regularly to school. By coming to school daily it helps students to learn more and they get good experience for coming to school by making new friends and getting to know more about school. And they wont feel any difficulty beacuse there will be someone who can help them whenever they want to. By taking online classes students dont learn more like they can can learn in school classes. Students should take the online classes only if it is needed them to complete all required credits they want to graduate. Online classes might help some people and they feel more comfotable. But in my opinion i would rather take in school classes because it would help me in future by getting good experience of highschool and learn more",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.3195674,3.1277804,3.431259,3.251193,3.0230072,3.1746655,2.9041502,2.77561,2.7341363,2.3952224,2.3340993,3.1845257,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,1118,47,0.1932021466905187,23.78723404255319,15,7,"{'electives', 'stressful', 'online', 'internet', 'cant', 'whats', 'wont'}"
32E2949B0C66,"Do you ever want to do something fun at your school that you really like? Well you came to the right school, cause the principal made a rule that you either have to play a sport or join a club that you like.

You could play on a basketball team

You could play on a football team

You could play on a flag football team

You could play on a baseball team

You could play on a softball team

You could play for a soccer team you could join a cheering team

I agree with the principal because, when we get home we don't do anything and kids are lazy nowadays. We either take a nap, eat, watch YouTube, or play video games. Also it will give kids a chance to have fun and make new friends and see what they like so they can do it the future.

So if you don't agree with me, I'll give more reasons like kids are overweight, they're lazy, most of them won't do anything cause they are out of shape. Probably the first thing they do when they get his eat and play video games and watch YouTube. So that is why the principal put in the new rule, they could make new friends while they're after school or join something their friends are in. Also it will be good if your going to play in high school sports cause you already known what it takes to be on the sport team.

It is really fun cause you when you play a game that is home you will feel good cause everyone from your school is there cheering you on. Also if you win your game at home it feels nice cause everyone is cheering your team on and then when you go back to school everyone will be taking about the win. If you don't believe me ask anyone that plays/played for a school team, most likely your parents played for a school team both of my parents did.

If your not interested in sports you could do other afters school activities like

Book club

Yearbook club

Dance club

Cooking club

Computer club

Student council

Engineering club

You could do those clubs in stead of playing sports, You could also do many other things that you like if you don't like any of this thing. Ask your teacher if you could make club and if she says yes go to her office. If you don't like your club cause everything was filled it is fine, cause you could join it the next semester but you have to be one of the first to sign the sign-up sheet. Also you be given a snack at the beginning of your after school period you could choose anything and, if you take the bus it will be there so you can go home.

But if you don't take the bus you will have to be picked up by 4:30 and then you be home and do whatever you want to do. But if your parent can pick you after school you could leave at the normal time school gets out and if your not feeling good you could also leave at the normal time. But before you could anything you have to do your homework and then go to your after school club.

If you don't want to go you will have to go to the principal and explain why you can't, but if it is a dumb reason you will have to go to after school. Like if you have a broken leg and you play on a sport team you could still go to practice and see what they are doing and see al the drills they are doing. Also if you fake an injure and the teacher find your big trouble cause you not listening to the principal. But you could get kicked out if your being bad and you will have to serve a punishment cause your still on school grounds. Like you you hit a student you will get suspended but if you hit the teacher you will get expelled.

If your playing sports it is all year long until the season ends, if your coach finds out your is taking drugs you will get kicked of the team. You will have the same rules as a high school cause you probably play for the high school team. But it won't costs any money cause the principal made us join the clubs so we could do something after school. Most likely we will find our hobby forever cause we are going to do it for the rest of the semester. If you find something that someone is doing and you want to do it just tell the teacher cause they will put you guys together.

If you still don't agree with me you should just try it out cause it fun, You could have fun, make new friends and bond over things you all like. Like sports if you join one of the sport teams you could meet someone with same interest like you. Same with all the other club that the school is providing to the students, like book club you could like the same book as someone else and be best friend over that one book cause you joined the book club. I met one of my best friend through basketball and we liked other stuff that wasn't basketball related.

Most likely you won't like it at first but then when your half-way through the year you will love it. Most of the time I join a club that i like cause it fun to meet new people that have the same interest as you. Sometimes the club isn't fun but that is okay cause you could join a new one. Most of the time everyone will be shy at the beginning cause no one knows each other but half way through the semester you will known everyone. Cause everyone won't be shy cause they will see you everyday plus, when your in school at lunch and you don't known anyone and you see one of those people you could sit with them. When you meet a new person they will have friends so you could more friends when the new person shows you to them.

So what we know is that joining an after school program could give you a lot of benefits and friend. Also they is a lot of clubs and sports you could join for fun. Also eat a free snack so your not hungry when you get home to your parents.

BF56324B3A86,"Do you know how many people are unhappy for be someone that they don't are?. At the present time in the world exist millions of people that don't live their life of the way that they want. Sometimes is difficult be yourself in a world where the whole people think that be different is wrong, but the truth is that the greatest accomplishment in the life of each human is be unique and have individuality in all your presence, because be yourself is the goal of the happiness, fight against the prejudice of everyone is not easy and accept you exactly like you are, looks like a war if the whole world is trying to change you.

Many people think that have a success and amazing life is have a lot of money, be an important person or have material things but all this things in really don't matter in the process of be yourself, because a person can have all this things but this things don't define you like a person and this aspects don't give the happiness, and something very important in the life of everyone is that, if you don't have happiness you don't have nothing. Is a fact that at least the 60 percent of people is not happy with their life, but studies affirm that this can change just if they choose be hones with themselves and take out of their life want they don't want. And the first step to be happy is be yourself. The people don't can live being liar with themselves, because this just bring like consequence a miserable life. A person have to accept their personality and their interest based on their thoughts. A serious consequence that the people get if they don't be honest with themselves are diseases like depression, This is a very dangerous problem and one of the most common causes are don't be agreeable with the person or the way that the person is living. For this and many others reasons is that is very difficult be yourself but is the biggest reward.

Alongside of your life you have to make a lot of decisions and is important always hear you. The people cannot allow that someone take decisions for they if that affect who are they.

First is very important know exactly what do you want because that is the same that be happy with yourself.

Always take your own opinion first, is the answer of be really happy because is very easy follow the opinion of the others based in their life's or be influenced for a world that always is trying to make you someone else, someone that they don't are. But at the end what a person want is the answer of be really happy.

Everyone in the world is trying to find their correct way in their life, and be honest about feelings and all mentioned in this paragraph can be the answer to arrive to the goal and be happy with yourself.

Is a fact that actually the world is a constantly war, because the majority of the citizens in the world are trying to fight for their rights and be honest with themselves and also with the whole world. But is true that this is not a easy task. The only person that someone need worry about what they going to think is yourself!, a person don't have to worry about the opinion of the others, just care what do you think!. Unfortunately, not everyone understand this, and sometimes the people wants that the world accept us form the simple fact of be a person. Is very hard be like you really are if millions of people want change your mind and they refuse to accept that everyone is different, that there are things that don't have that be equal and that it's fine, that the diversity is part of a balance. Everyone is here, in their country, in their community to learn about the others, and have respect of they, don't care their race, color, language, traditions, customs and many others things that represent and define a person, this is the correct, not be equal. Nowadays a lot of people is trying to make this world a better place where the prejudices not exist and where each person can be what they want and have the rights that the people need and deserve. Is a difficult battle but without doubt the result is the greatest accomplishment. And is a fact that if the people are happy with how they are, and they accept their form of be, with their qualities and defects, anyone, and studies repeat that anyone can affect you, because you are really on the top of the goal and when you are there nothing can make you go down.

Many philosopher and researchers believe that the problem with the society that don't accept and allow the people that is different, is because since the beginning of the world the people hidden their really feelings and interests for the fear of be rebounded. In part is own fault because the people never said something when something was wrong, but never is late, an actually the majority of the people is trying to change the perspective about what is fine in the world. That is why accept you exactly like you are, looks like a war if the whole world is trying to change you. We have to be strong and don't allow that anyone dispute your decisions. Another reason therefore is hard be yourself is for you, sometime the people are so exigent with themselves, you are your own most hard critical. If everyone would honest with themselves , this would be something normal for the society, but is such difficult accept us, that is seen wrong be unique. We definitely have to change this way of see the circumstances and make it normal.

Is clearly that we have a lot of learn but I think that we going to the correct way. The people have to travel many obstacles for win their individuality and always remember where we are and where we want arrive.

Be yourself, is really difficult if a whole society is telling you that you can not be different and that be unique is wrong, because how you can understand who are you, if anyone give you the chance to know it, but without doubt discover the answer will be the best accomplishment that a person can have because live being you, is the better that could exist, for a complete life.

7373B4F44528,"Have you ever accomplished something in your life? Because people nowadays are very lazy and hard headed because they are easily distracted by social media, people around them, and also the society that's why they cannot focus on their goals in life. Although some might argue it is not better to work on something to accomplish, actually it is better to work on something to accomplish because you will gain more knowledge and people will be proud to what you've accomplished.

One reason why it is better to work on something to accomplish is because you will gain more knowledge. For instance, based on my personal experience when I was in middle school, I dont do my projects, homework, seat works because I'm too lazy and I just love talking with my friends everyday in our class. However, when I moved here in America last year things have changed because I'm new here in this country and I dont know anyone. I realized that my friends here are not the same like in the Generic_City that I used to talk to everyday. That's why I decided to study hard and make my parents proud again. I have an five A's in my classes right know and I'm proud because I accomplished something. And yes, Thomas Jefferson was right ""Determine never to be idle.. It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something.""

we should never stop doing something that can benefit us. This proves that working on something will help you gain more knowledge in life and dont stop believing in yourself. Another example that proves it is better to work on something to accomplish is based on my dad's personal experience. My dad was a college graduate in the Generic_City, he dreamed to become a successful businessman and he made it. My dad started a business near to schools and shops so many people will go to his store. The first few months was amazing because his customers was very loyal to him my dad didn't expect that it will happen. Unfortunately, my dad's business went down because something happened that he didn't liked. People are robbing and digging all the way to my dad's store every night. That's why he was forced to closed his business and rest for a while. After a few years he didn't have a job because he was still shocked to what happened to his business. However, he decided to take culinary class to work again because he wants to help our family and to gain more knowledge about baking. After taking the culinary, he went to Generic_City to seek new opportunity. He is now currently working in five star restaurant owned by a rich man in Generic_City. This proves that it is better to work on something to accomplish like what my dad did in his life and he changed for a better living.

Another reason why it is better to work on something to accomplish is because people will be proud to what you've accomplished. For example, from the movie

PELE

it is about a young boy who dreamed to become a professional football player. He lived in a small house in Brazil and played football with his friends in his neighborhood. Pele was a poor little kid but plays well even he is very short unlike other people in his town. When they play against other teams, they always laugh at them because they dont have a proper gear for playing. And there is a guy who is recruiting players for their club. Pele was the youngest player in the club thats why he was treated like a slave. After few years playing in his club, its his time to shine to represent Brazil in the world cup. Pele scored a lot of goals and Brazil went to the finals. He was so incredible that time no one can stop him and Brazil won the world cup. This proves that you need hard work to accomplish something like Pele he never stop doing what he wanted to be and now people from Brazil and all over the world are proud of him. Another example that proves it is better to work on something to accomplish comes from Adidas' quote or saying ""All in or nothing"". For instance, that line is very effective to people especially the athletes around the world because doing your goals in life makes you more stronger and better than the others. And you should give your best all the time and make people proud to what you've done in life. This proves that is it better to work on something to accomplish like the owner of Adidas he became famous and rich because he worked hard, focused on his goals.

The other side will argue it is not better to work on something to accomplish because you will have more time to do what you want or something else. However, it is better to work on something because you can practice your weaknesses. For example, my friend Generic_Name who really dont know how to write a perfect essay but can speak fluent in English. He was really bad in writing essay when we were in middle school. Generic_Name was always shy to read or present his work to our teacher. So, I told him to work with my classmate who is really good in making essay and ask him to teach Generic_Name how to write a perfect essay. After a few weeks of learning, Generic_Name improved his writing skills. This proves that it is better work on something to accomplish like what my friend Generic_Name did he started practicing his weakness and became a good writer. Another example that proves that it is better to work on something to accomplish is based on my personal experience. For instance, I've been playing football since 5 years old because my dad is also a football player. When I was playing with my club my coach said my first touch is not really good unlike the other players. However, I practiced by myself like what what coach told me. And my mentality was I should prove my coach that I will be a better football player. This proves that practicing your weaknesses will make you more a better person.

To conclude all these statements above, it is better to work on something to accomplish because you will gain more knowledge and people will be proud to what you've accomplished. We people have different purposes in life, we should never be idle in life.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.7601588,3.5795798,3.8939219,3.6879344,3.4661672,3.6856148,3.0201457,2.6844857,3.1679764,3.1444144,2.1065922,2.5752175,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,1118,56,0.3211091234347048,19.964285714285715,12,6,"{'5', 'classmate', 'culinary', 'homework', 'mentality', 'robbing'}"
E19E1BEB08EA,"I feel that working with a partner is more beneficial to students. Working with partners gets students extra help when in need. It can make new friends while working on big projects. Also it makes the work get done easier and quicker when working in big groups. I also personally think that any project with a presentation should be a group project. If that presentation has more than just the presentation it should be a three person group.

Working with a partner is beneficial to students, because it gives extra support or help on a project or classwork. If a project is too big and impossible for one person to complete they could split up the work. For example, when I had a final project in my english class; I separated the work with my partner. We had to do an essay and a PowerPoint presentation. My partner did the essay and did the PowerPoint presentation and we both finished in time. If I hadn't had my partner, I probably would not have finished the project in time. My teacher making it a group project made it way easier to do because I didn't have to worry about writing essay.

Another reason that working with partners is beneficial to students is that they can build new friendship while doing work. When students are doing work in groups, they are together the whole class and have to stay in contact outside of school. For example, when I was working on a video for my journalism class I had a very big video that was due in a few days. I made good friends with the people that were in that group because we spent the whole class together and staying in contact after school. Every time I'm making a video I want to work with them because I know they will do a good job.

Another way that working in partner benefits students is that it saves them time and makes them finish their work quicker. If the students split up their work and do their work efficiently they will finish quickly. The more group members will make it even quicker. For example, when I was working with a friend and two other students on a project for a book we finished the book very quickly and the book review was finished very quickly as well. When partners are helping each other it makes everything way easier and more fun as well, because you get to hang out with your friends while being productive.

Also if the teacher lets students pick people, they can pick people that know a lot about the topic of the project or classwork. For example, in when I had spanish we did a project about Puerto Rico and since I'm from Puerto Rico everyone wanted to pick me. I went to a group where a good friend of mine was and the project was very easy to finish and present. The project was done so quickly that the next class we had free time for the whole class. That's another reason why working in groups is so beneficial and good.

Working with partners can also make students more comfortable with the subject or the project. Students sometimes get handed a project or classwork without knowing what to do. Having a partner to help the out is great so they can get comfortable with the subject or the project. For example, when I was Earth and Space Science I had no idea what to do on a project the teacher was assigning. She assigned partners and my partner told me what to do and I finally understood. The project took us about two days to finish but it was a very hard project to do that would have been impossible to finish alone.

Groups of at least three people should be required for project of more than 2 assignments. Two people can't do a project with five assignments and should have that extra person to split up the work and no one does extra work. For example, when I was in the sixth grade I had a project where I had to write about Mozart's story and I had to write an two paragraphs, buy and design a poster board, and also give a presentation and memorize everything. I did the essay but forgot to do the poster board until the night before. I had to stay up to 12:30 at midnight doing the poster and memorizing the 2 paragraphs. If the teacher would have made it a group project, I wouldn't have had to worry about the poster because my group members were on top of it.

Another reason that groups of at least three people benefit students is that maybe one of the students doesn't want to do any work there's still another group member left that wants to do the work. For example, my english teacher gave us a presentation to do on PowerPoint and we split up the slides. But one of the group members didn't do anything, so the other group member and me had to do all of his work. We presented got points and he didn't. That's why it's so important to have groups of at least three people, because you still have a backup.

Some people say working alone is beneficial for students because you only have to worry about yourself and no one else. However, if you work with a group or a partner the work gets done quicker and easier. While doing your work you can also make new friends and get help from them. Also, it helps pick out partners for the future that you know that those people will execute and do their work. For example, when I was working on a video for my journalism class I had a very big video that was due in a few days. I made good friends with the people that were in that group because we spent the whole class together and staying in contact after school. Every time I'm making a video I want to work with them because I know they will do a good job and be productive.

I feel that working with a partner is more beneficial to students. Working with partners gets students extra help when in need. It can make new friends while working on big projects. Also it makes the work get done easier and quicker when working in big groups. Bigger projects have to be at least a three person group because two people can't handle big projects by them selves and should have extra help. That's why it's so beneficial for students to work with partners on projects and other big classworks.

3498E7E2DAB6,"In the principals office there is quote stating that "" your life can be beneficial if your doing something very productive, because it can lead you to great success in life"" In some way we ask ourselves if we are do something with our lives and be thinking ahead on what we want to do with our life and what can take us to success. Is that true?. Its more than just having something to do. Life is very short, As long as you are doing something with success. Living is an option as well as just giving up and not trying very enough. Accomplishing something in life to any dream you want to have. If you dont try as hard in life, you will never succeed and imagine all those who gave up and thinking... Where they are now?. Living life can only be chosen just by you and it's only your choice to think in what direction you want to take. Although some may believe that life,belief, and hope prove that doing something with your own future can accomplish and lead you to a successful life.

Your life can be turned around very quick, if only you are doing something very little that makes you happy and know that sticking with it, can take you anywhere you want in your future just only by trying and not giving up on your own self. Not trying and thinking way ahead of your own future can bring yourself down which can lead you to depression, low self of esteem , and as well of not having very much hope. In human society it has been discovered that in most of our population much as 40% of our people in the U.S are unemployed and don't have anything to do which leads them to go down in their life. There is so much poverty going on in this world and just by thinking about it and you think to yourself and say what did they do wrong in life that brought them to were they are now?. Your future can be so easy as long as you try and have hope in your own self. Just by knowing that you have accomplished anything in life can lead your own way to success. Your future can only be held in your hand no one else. Like its said once life can only chosen due too live a long term of time or short period of time its all held under your back, your shoulders, and your own self future. Being successful life is very important to your life having many accomplishment can make your self feel very motivated and make it very good. You can make your life very easy and not to hard just as long your are doing something that makes you happy and also as long what right direction you are taking and what good path is in your way. Life isnt easy either, it can be very difficult just as long as your trying at your very best and your pushing yourself into having great success, you will be at your very best and the top est you can be. The choice you make, can make it very effectively on you and it can change anything.

The make key in life is as well having much belief on your own future or in life.

Belief can only be happened by you and no one else, It can be very good and at its best just as long your try and making your life not to difficult. Having belief isnt bad at all its just a feeling you have on yourself and that the feeling makes it good for just for yourself and no one other. Every person in the world is very different in their way, everyone isnt the same in the way you see or in the perspective you think in. In society each person can think any type of way they want and they only problem is that you should be only be worrying about yourself but no other. There has been many issues due too how you believe and what others think about you and get to worried about it. Our world shouldnt be like that, in our belief we should stay positive in each one of us and stay motivated in any situation you go through. The belief in come in any one and whoever think in the mindset of way, we can all go through difficult times and not have any belief in ourselves. But only yourself can change no other can do that for you. The accomplishment in life can mean allot in yourself and can also have no good beneficial idea just for you, but something you can also do is give a big impact in human society.

In setting a good state of mindset can change you very completely, another word to help yourself could also be hope. Having hope could lead you very far in life and also having great accomplishments that can also lead you to a big success. If you cant see it but others can see how your life is being impacted on you not doing something with your life. Only you can change that, but as others can't. Another key to life is hope. It can take you very far and also lead you in any direction yourself takes or as well in any path you want. Having hope is an option and a belief you want or can have. Not every person has hope or believes in themselves because all they want too do is fail. Others can see you fail and not try, but it is very hard for you to see yourself. In life if you have it can lead too do good things in life and have great accomplishments that no other has, just by having good hope. Just know to yourself that having hope can lead yourself to great victory and a great life that no other can have but you.

In those who dont believe that if are doing something isnt an accomplishment to success, which that takes my position in saying that themselves thinking that is wrong. Because a key to success in life is having many accomplishments and lead you very far. But in those who also say that being inactive is a way too success is also wrong on their point of view and isn't a true fact statement. Inactivity cant take you too far in life and isnt a beneficial success to life. Having anything to do that you enjoy can lead too good accomplishments and also great success.

Having a great life,hope, and belief can take you very far and lead you to any direction or path you want to take. Any one can have a great life just as long as you try. Life is easier as long you make it a success.

15BDA0989B56,"When you trying to make something different every day, is the greatest accomplishment.

I'm agree about Emerson's Statement !

Well, when you be yourself you every moment want to be something else,something new to know how capacity you have to be yourself. When you thinking in yourself your days be more easy, fun, you enjoy yourself in a world because you are only in the world nobody is like you, you are the only who make the better decisions in your life and is something constantly trying to make you something else because is the most and greatest accomplishment that you have is like a gift that your received and you need to care.

When you constantly trying to make you something you learn something that you don't know; something that surprise you because you never think that you can do, and you say I can do that thing and I want to experiment more things spontaneous because is better when that things have spontaneous because left better and so cool and impressive to you. Experiment more things new help you to be better every moment, to that these for you can helped an others persons when they need our help, when meet with one situation where somebody need help motivate that he or she can do it nothing is impossible, because a lot of peoples in the world don't believe in their self because all that time suffrage bullying they thing that they don't serve for nothing they believe in that bad words, is for these reasons that one situation appear in front of our eyes helped, spoke with love,respect,be courteous because when you spoke with one persons that have these problems where suffrage bullying, bad words that others peoples say they feel miserable have hatred,resentment and all of times they don't want to talk, you need or our need to going to these peoples and spoke with love, love is one of the most good gun that we have is the most important in that around world. A lot of peoples suffrage depression, anxieties, contempt, and racism, and to much peoples lose their lives because they don't support all that bad words,contempt and racism they suicide about that bad situation that they pass, is not necessary to arrive to these situation when we can change that world, stop to that bullying,racism we need to stay up, help these peoples and to these form too we be better persons these help too to our lives to see all that things different and get a solution because nothing is impossible when you purpose to me a good and better person.

Is time to care yourself, is time to listen your heart, yours words, and be better for yourself not for that others peoples, is time to return to be you for make that things that you want for you,don't make things for that others peoples see, want at have happy peoples, made because you want to continue with you life, dreams, expectations, careers, and because these make that you feel happy, interesting, confident, sure, cute, fun, and enjoy your victory. We need to get that goods words specific when it's for important persons because they want that better things for you, you don't need to get the bad words that you need to put in the trash so to these form that bad words don't affect you in nothing in your life. Then when you need to be something don't tell to everybody because a lot of time that peoples have envious yours victories then they get a angry things because have zealous that you did it. The important things spoke with that persons that really is important to you that person helped you to celebrate later your victory with you.

Make your things individuality because that work that you doing left good and you have your owns opinions,strategies,problems,situation,statements,solutions you work better when you work individually, like these work on me, when a work individuality I have my owns ideas because when a work in groups I feel that a can't put all my ideas a need to put all that ideas together and them we need to decide for one of the ideas the most interesting and important ideas, for me is better when you work individuality.

Trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplished, bec a use you can learn and make a new thing,because every day our want to change the world with all bad expectations, etc we need to care whatever word that we spoke to don't hurt nobody with any word all persons in all of world needed be different because a lot kids in these time what make whatever they want don't want to make that parents say that is something that we need to change.

Yourself is something that need to care because these defined what type of people you are, the values that you have, is something delicate and important; You need to have persons that helped you to be better every moment in your life,person who import good things on you, how stay with you in (bad & good) moments that person you want the best for you, who was happy when you get the victories because that is that things that you received and help you to make that same things with that person,we need to know who really is our friend.

-

Friend is who really want to support you how really wants good things for you that friends is that care you to do the true and better things.

Friend is not who don't help you, how don't care that important things for you that not be friends. All need to see very true who is really a friend.

Yourself is something happiness is like a emotional thing that you can share with your family, friend, that important persons for you, in yourself you feel a comfortable with you body because a lot of persons don't feel good with their body and suffrage for these. When you are sure with yourself and believe and yourself you feel happy,emotion, is something that we need to care a lot for no feel bad when a person who don't want to our things that we are doing. When you believe in yourself all around you is happy every moment,hour,minute,second.

DD279F25DC1F,"""Oh my God Generic_Name,"" I did not have enough time to finish my power point, me too Generic_Name said. I think our school should add two hours more and we should come four-day school weeks like some businesses they work for ten hours and they only work four days it can benefits students and teachers because, some students can have more time to do their homework, some teachers and students can saved more gas and money, and some students can ask their teacher for more help.

First,students and teachers saved more gas and money. For example, my friend needs to drive herself to school everyday and she needs to pay for her gas. The other day she told me that coming to school for five days is stressful because, she has to pay for gas and she is not working everyday like she just too, so her parents have to pay the gas for her .They told her if she do not start to pay for her own gas they where going to take the car away from her, I told her about how some businesses have adopted just going four- days to work for ten hours and I told her that our school should have four-day school week too, I think that would be a good idea and she thinks that is a great idea too, because she gets to saved money and gas and she do not have to worry about paying a lot of money for gas anymore and her parents would not be mad at her anymore because she would have the money to pay for gas.

Other example can be my Spanish teacher she lives a little far from school and she has to drive to school, but she is having some problems and she does not have enough money to pay for her gas. She told me that if she do not get the money to pay her gas she was going to be absent for some day into she get the money to buy gas for her car, that make me so sad because she is my favorite teacher, she is like a mom to me, and she would not be able to come to school just because she dont have enough money to pay her gas. My friend told her about what I said and she things its a great statement because she would have more time to grade students homework ad would have more time to spent with her family.

Second, students can have more time to do their homework. For example, myself sometimes in my math or chemistry class we talk about something new and it takes almost the hold class and my teachers give us a lot of homework so I think the if we go school for ten hours it would be great because I would have a lot of time to do all my homework or I would have time to study too and I would just get home to relax and I would not get stress because I already did my homework.

Other example can be my best friend Generic_Name, she is taking all AP classes, and she gets a lot of homework sometime she does not get the enough time to finish her homework in class and when she gets home she has to take cared of her little sister, so she does not have time to finish her homework at home or sometimes she has projects do the next day but she does not have enough time finish in class. Generic_Name said that she gets really stress about all her homework and how she has to do it in so little time, she thinks if we go to school for more time she would have a lot of time to do her homework and she would just go home and take care of her little sister, she should not have to be stress about doing her homework.

Another example can be my friend Generic_Name, she loves to do homework because she likes to compete with other students, but ladle she has being so worry and angry about everything. I ask her why does not she compete with the other kids like she used to, she told me because she has a lot of test's coming up and she needs to study and that she wish that we have more time in school so she can get everything done the same day because now she has to take her homework to her house and finished over there, now she does not get time to relax and chill like she always did.

Third, some students can ask their teacher for more help. Like myself the other day in math class we were talking about a new topic it was so hard that I did not understand the topic. After the teacher show us how to do it, I was asking for help every three seconds because I did not understand, after she explain me for the hundred time I was still confused, before the class end she gave us homework I did not how to do the homework ether, so I stay after with her so she could it explain me again, but the after school time is only for fifteen minutes. My teacher explain me again and show me how to do it again but I did not get it, she told me the if we have more time in school hours it would be better because would take her time and explain us how to the work more slow, but we only have like one hour in her class so we do not get enough time ask a lot of questions. Other example, my friend Generic_Name sometimes his teacher talk so fast that he can understand what she is saying, he want it to stay after school so she could explain him again, but he could not stay because needed to go soccer practice he being missing a lot of day because he always stay after school with a teacher for extra help and if he does not start going to soccer practice again, his coach is going to kick him out of the team, he is the only one that has been missing a lot of days, and he needs to get back in track because his team has a really important game coming up, so he can not stay after school for help anymore.

Some students think that they get stress for being in school for a lot of time;however, they are wrong because some students think that if they go to school for a lot of time they would get more time to do their homework.

Some students and teachers get to saved more money and gas, some student can have more time to do their homework, and some students can ask their teacher for more help this are some benefits of why should my school adopt a four-day school week.",4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.1601384,2.9309003,3.2983398,3.0821903,2.804101,3.0299942,2.776318,2.7616053,2.9948936,2.6566188,2.7733955,2.897915,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1173,21,0.2216538789428815,55.85714285714285,6,6,"{'ladle', 'mom', 'stressful', 'soccer', 'homework', 'ether'}"

In the past few years, there has been many teenagers that go to college and try to do a career that they think they are able to work with, but after few days of studying for that career,they see that that's not for them, and they just drop out. Our schools and our parents have been trying to help us decide what we really want to do in our future before we enter college, that way we don't do the same mistake some people did. Now schools have a program where you get to choose what career you think you are interested in, and see if it's really what you want for your future. That way you have a chance to either stick with it or look for other career you could be interested in.

I want to be able to see if the career I want to take it's really for me or not. I think whatever career someone chooses, it shouldn't just be for the money, it should also be for some that makes you happy and that you are going to be able to stick with your whole life. My friend Generic_Name graduated in 2014, and he started to attend to Generic_school. He studied to be an architect, but the only reason he wanted to be an architect was because he wanted to help his family out with some money. Generic_Name was struggling to be an architect, because it was a lot of math, and he wasn't really good with numbers. What Generic_Name really liked to do was to fix cars with his older brother. He couldn't do it no more, he dropped out of college, and started working with what he knew was gonna make him happy. He worked for a whole year as a mechanic and saved money, that way he could have his own business and help his family out. He finally did it, he has his own business now and whenever there's a problem with my mom's car or my dad's car, we go to him. This is what I'm talking about, he never had the chance to see how hard that career could be and if it was going to make him happy. I don't want to do the same mistake, I want to know what I will be getting into and see if that career really is for me.

If you give me the chance to go,visit,and learn about the career I'm interested in. It does not only help me to see if It's really for me or not but I will also learn new things I didn't know and those things, they could help me in life. I want to be doctor and to get there, you have to go through a lot. As right now, I'm attending to a nurse class where I learn the basic things like knowing how to do blood pressure, learning body parts and learning a lot of vocabulary. I also know three languages: Spanish, English and Latin. After finishing my nursing class, I want to attend to Generic_school, because I've heard their doctor and nursing class is the best. The only reason I want to be a doctor is to help people out and be able to keep them healthy without any problems. My dad wanted to me to be an electrician because that's what he is, but I told him that wasn't really my thing. He taught me all he knew, that way if i ever have a problem with that, I would know what to do. One time i went to a friends house, and it was already 9:00 pm. Out of nowhere, the lights of the all house went off. So what me and my friend did was, turn the flashlight on of our phones to be able to see. His parents were freaking out, because they knew it was late already and there probably wouldn't be any electrician that would pick up the phone. I told my friend that this i could fix this because my dad already taught me how to do it. I called my dad to make sure I was right, since he's the one that knows everything about it. I was able to fix it and turn the lights on again at my friend's house. They thanked me and were surprised for knowing all this kind stuff already. Every career is important, it might not be the one for you but you will always learn new things that will help you in life, like it helped me.

There might be people that say to just look for a job where you get paid well, or people that say a career is too much because you have to study a lot, so I'll just go and work as a waitress. Yes, it is important to try to get a job that pays you well, everyone likes to make money. But if you don't like the job you are doing everyday, then you won't ever be happy with what you are doing. That's why you have to find a job that's really for you. You do have to study a lot to have a career, of course you have to. Because you are not only helping yourself, you are helping other people that's going to need your help. This is why it's important to know what you really want for yourself.

I am writing you this letter because i want to know what I am going to get into, I want to know if this career really is for me, because I want to make sure I stick with my decision. Like I said before, if It's not what I want, then that's okay because I've learned new things that will always help me in life. If it's not for me, then there's always another way, you can look for other career and see if you are interested in. I know there's more people that probably want the same chance as me, but I hope you choose me. It's not just because the money I want this chance but also because I want to help people out. I want an opportunity to see what I really want.

424005E31A04,"Do people ever told that having a positive attitude is the key to success in life ?

Well,that true for you to be success in life you got to have a positive attitude .

when you talking around attitude is how we act ,talk ,and how we deal with thing that are happening. Say that person you are working with and the person next to you do or says something that is not so great, and let say that you were really mad and very upset about ,and you choose not to fight or talk back to him/her. In my preview I would say you act base on what happen and you had a positive attitude about what just happen. Attitude can be a big problem for some people and Sometimes you just need to have a positive attitude .When your thoughts think that positive attitude is the key to success will you not wrong ,I know that when you choose to have a positive attitude it depend on what going on and how you want to handle the matter .For example you are on your way to the school and you meet one of the teacher let say Mrs. Jade,will Mrs. Jade asks if you are okay and she ask you if you are gonna come to school because you have many days of absent at school , and say that you have your own personal problems and you just don't want to tell her about it .So you decide not answer her because you are not in a good mood and you might talk to her rudely and she would think that you have an attitude or bad behavior and thought if I have problem with her or be rude to her it would be the worse so I will not say anything .That would it and you would just kindly walk way. Attitude can be anything in life attitude is not just the way you treat other it can be how you manage things and how you think and act with a positive attitude. When you think back it can also be something that create your connection with those who are in your surroundings. For example when you meet a someone for the first time and you were nice to them everything about you was positive and you were did not hind anything from her and that person might draw a liking into you .And you might end up being their friends or bests. The thing of having positive attitude is that many people might not act the same way as you ,so you have to be the one being positive .People say a beautiful heart comes from in and out of that person .It the same thing with having a great positive attitude when think about it people do and say what they want to said and no one is stopping them .So with positive attitude is the same way people do it because they want to and even if you say that you want to stop them I don't think that you would do it. Because it their choice to do what they want to do .Say when you want to eat can anyone stop you and if not then why would they stop you from what your doing .These things we do it so that our life can be great base on what we see we act,make choice ,and choose the right or wrong that why everything we do in this world we do it with positive attitude .And think about when you are making choices do you have to be a greater thinker or smart no all you have to do is have a great idea and a positive attitude to it when you say it because sometimes thing are easy said then done .when a person is saying something or doing something they have a way of doing and saying that this day .when people are talking they use attitude to do or say something and you have to away think that your the only one doing but sometimes it not just you it might be the other way around and you might say oh ,so that how it done .What l'm saying is that positive attitude can be a good thing to those who know what it means to them and why they are having it. Have you ever meet a person they're so nice to you when no body is around ,but when people are around they act so mean to you ,and some people are really nice to you ,because they mean it and they want to be your friend and when you at some of these thing does have something to do with positive attitude and most of them just put on an act and when your the one they doing this to sometimes you don't if having positive attitude or not everybody knows what we do in the future but I know one thing for sure .That if you have a positive attitude ,The your future clear for sure because when you about the future the only thing that comes to mind is how are success and all you need is positive attitude and focus on what you can do because believing is living .And if you believe you have to have that positive attitude going ,because once you start a journey one can never stop until it's end ,Positive attitude can be the thing that can help you do what other can't do ,if you ask why it because you have a life and that most of the people in the the world need positive attitude so that they can have a peaceful life and one most never stop until you find what your looking for. Having a good attitude can not only be the key to success in life but it can help you be a wonderful person. Being kind to someone,helping people,and making people about you happy and it can also make you happy. why ,because you have a positive attitude and when you success in life you will be happy. The thing is when talking about positive attitude can be the key to success in life, is like you are talking about happiness is a wonderful thing that happen in a world and make people happy. So when saying key to success in life your talking about how you act ,respect,what you do?, and how will you success in it when your looking for positive attitude so that you can success. Their are not a lot people who have a positive attitude in this world,but their are people who are bringing positive attitude in this world. When you think about success in life do you think it would be great if everyone had the chance to be success in life ,but to be fair life is suppose to be hard that way we can learn from our mistakes. Positive attitude help you be success in life ,because we live we learn everyone is a learner in this world. Because no one is perfect or wonderful forever.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.8519273,2.6616044,3.0908542,2.8471246,2.536935,2.674189,3.1723728,3.1536787,3.447525,3.784062,3.0447998,3.03685,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,1205,21,0.2240663900414937,57.38095238095238,9,6,"{'jade', 'bests', 'hind', 'learner', 'preview', 'rudely'}"
AB86BAABBF68,"It's a good idea for students to graduate of three years of high school instead of taking for years, i think if they have already passed their classes then they would not have to take elective classes and they might be able to graduate early, but if they need more then seven classes then they might do not be able to graduate and they will have to come during summer to complete their classes that they need to pass.

For example if they are still missing some of the work they had to complete at the end of the year they would have to come during summer school or maybe take more classes then what they were allow to be taking.

If they need to complete more work they might come during summer break, i think it would be good if you have all your classes that you need in order to graduate since when you come to ninth grade, so at the end of high school you might just come to skool just for maybe two classes and it would be better for you becase you need to pass all your classes either way in order to graduate.

and you are assigned with seven SOL and one for english actually you have to be able to pass all the work that youre assigned you must complete all these before you go to the 12th grade, because if you dont complete these assignments before thatnthen you will strugle with these at the end of the senior year of high school, but if you complete all your work that means that you are ready to graduate.

For example i am taking four classes that i need to graduate, but i am taking three elective classes because i wanted to learn more, and i did not want to go home early, so i told my counselour i wanted to get three more classes, but it is because i took all the classes i needed to take during the freshman, sophomore and junior year, so now that i am in twelve grade i just have to take just four main classes with are the ones i need in order to graduate.

Even tho it would have been a good idea to come in summer because i can learn more, but also would not be a good idea because then i would not be able to graduate on time, or mostly like i would have to come to turn in the work i did not finish during school year, and that would b bad because i want to graduate on time just like the other people that passed all theur classes so i need to put that effort and see or talk with the teacher and ask them what do ni need in order to pass all my classes if i am missing some work i have to turn it in.

I want to complete all the work due on time because if i do not turn in the work i am assigned to do then that would affect my grades and that will take me away from graduation, wich i have been waiting for since ninth grade,

So i think it is good to complete your work in class, or if you have homework assigned then we must complete it, or like sometimes the teachers put some work in google classroom with dates due, so we must turn the work on time and complete all of it, becase if we do not do it our grades are going to go down and that means we will not be passing the classes that we need to pass and that will not let us walk in the stage

We must complete all the work, if we do complete all that is assigned then we will be good and would not have to worry about our grades because the grades will be good too, that is why i say that we need to complete the work and sometimes pay attention to what the teacher is explaining that helps us to understand and make the work easy, but if we do not pay attention, at the end of the day or at the end of the class we will have problems with the understanding of the theme we have studied in class because we did not pay attention in class while the teacher was explaining.

One of the examples of not paying attention in class is, what is going to come next like we are going to get very bad grades, so we must do all the work listen while someone is giving instructions because that way we would not have problems with anything and when the test comes up we are going to be prepared to take it and get high grades, because we already studied and if we review our work before we turn it in and make sure everything is good and in order so we would get a good grades.

So other reason why we get good grades is if we come to school everyday because if we miss more then ten days we will get suspended and that will mess up your grades because you are abnsent and you will not be able to see or work in the class wich is better because if you do not come to school for couple of weeks then you will not know when you come back to school, you will be lost because you have already missed some of the work we already did while you was not here, so for me i rather coming to shool even though i am sick or something because otherwise i will bring my grades down and one missing day of school will make all my work come down or bring all my classes down because i have been absent and when i come back to school i would not know what to do.

It is good to keep your grades up and stay them in the same level because that will help ypu tp graduate, so one of my examples is if i come to school and complete all my work, then i do not have to worry about my grades, but ut is not only about your grades or what you do in class is also about what we get in the test and that will be product of the work and effort we put in class if we did good in our notes or study guides that means we will be great in the test too because it is the same that we learn in class it is all the same what will come in the test, so we need to stay focused and ask for help the teacher if we do not understand what we are doing in class.

The teachers are able to help in anything we want, well if it is about the classwork because sometimes we do not understand at all but we can review work and try the best for the next class, we always need to make sure our work is complete before we turn it in because if you have a small mistake that will bring your grades down too and we will not pass our classes and make sure complete everything, in order to graduate.",3.5,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.238749,3.0171077,3.4292755,3.235858,3.0169306,3.0551841,3.6336677,3.3075578,3.4998963,3.403261,3.4587948,3.6411972,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,1229,11,0.2131814483319772,111.72727272727272,16,7,"{'homework', 'ut', 'elective', 'classwork', 'tho', 'sol', 'shool'}"
E4051C85D12E,"If we think about the words that the British Prime Minister Wiston Churchill sait "" succes consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" There is a lot of truth is this words well that is what I believe. So how important is the role that failure plays in the process to reach success and don't loss enthusiasm in the proccess? In my opinion it is very important because it make us gain experience, improve our skills, and it make you feel comfortable and happy at the end.

Les't think about how you feel when your staring in the proccess to reach a new goal that you propose to youself it could be hard at the begin, because is your first time in that enviroment and maybe you have none experience there, and that could make you to fail some times and could be desesperate to you.

you or people migth say, "" this is not for me,"" because you already fail a few time and you think but is just the beginc how will be the future. That could make you loss enthusiasm, but if you think what happend when you keep going with all this fails you're gaining a lot of experience during that proccess. For example, when I star to study at Generic_School it was a big change for me staring with the lenguage, because I came from a coutry of Spanish speakers and here the official lenguage is English, so I remember that in the begin my English was really poor, and I just knwe a few words in English like good morning or the name of some school's supplies, but everytime I did something wrong I learnd something new from that mistake wich make me gain experience in the proccess of my English learning. Even if sometimes is embarasing to say or spell worng a word infront of people you will be learning to do it rigth with the time. Therefore we should see the fails as a good oportunitie to gain more experience.

Most of the time you will notice some changes in yourself while you're reaching some goal, I'm talking about the change on your own skills. That could be maybe improve some skills that you already had before or in the best of the cases developing a new one. Using the last example that I used, when I star to learn English I remember that my speaking was the most hard part for me, because is hard to think a word first in Spanish and then traslate that word in to English and also spell that word correct just on your mind. Sometimes I started a sentence but then I couldn't finish it. That was so embarrassing for me, but with the time that problem has been decreased not all, but now is not like the begin. Sometimes that happend to me again when I'm doing presentation or when I'm imfront of nwe people that i have never met. But I feel that the practice has been helping me to decrease that problem and now is easier for me to speak with some body in English at school or in my job . Even if you feel bad or embarrassing to fail with the time that will help. You can be improving skills or even descoviring new ones while you fail that is part of the whole proccess of reach success.

Maybe for some people the fact of fail is the worst thing that can happend to them in the proccess to reach success some of them could say,"" You have to do perfect if you want to reach your goals,"" but I think that we can not do perfection without failure. Failure is a big and les't say importnat part of reach success. Have you ever heard the words , "" No pain, No gain,""

I like that words, because reminds me how good feels when you reach a goal in wich you speend a lot of time or maybe hard work.

For example, when you have a big test at school and you have been studing for that test all nigths for a week or even more and the day of the test you know all the anwers for that test and you got an A or A+ as a grade that feels so good and comfortable to you. Just because of your hard work you are getting all this good grades that you gain by yourself. That is one of the best sensations that you can ever feel or experiment. Using my example agin I can say that all the result of my hard work that I have done helping me to get good gains in my English developing .

Not matter howmany times you fail the last feeling is best in the world. Because is the result of all your hard work. Sometimes I remember how hard was for me to star school in a differnt country, but when I see that I'm about to garduate and get my High School diploma it reminds me all the hard work that I have done during this almost 2 years that I have studing here in Generic_School.

It could sound bad when you hear the word failure or fail when your trying to reach a goal, but if you think we should see all the forms that this words have. Success is not all about fail there is more. We have to go deeper into that words. As I said fail is a big and important part in the way to reach a goal. Success is a big proccess with branches and one of this branches is the failure. But failure give us more than we think. it give us experience that could prepare us for future problems or future goals, it also prepare or improve your skill and even if you don't have one you could descover one that you didn't notice, and finally, but no less important the comfortable feeling that give you at the end is incredible because remind you all the hard work that you have done. So I think if you don

't want to lloss enthusiasm during the proccess of reach success you shouldn""t see the word failure as it is you should go deeper in to try to understand the important role that it plays in the pursuit of success. I just mencion three reasons here but there could be more than three just don't think that just because you fail is the end of the world instead see how failure could help you to reach that important goal your or success. I hope all the time that I've fail in my English speaking will help me to in the future became in a perfect bilingual speaker having my home lenguahge Spanish and my new home lenguage English.

CCDD77656701,"Do you thing that most danger of us lies not setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark? Sometimes is not good to tell others what you want because some of them may not want good things for you to get or have, you want to not used too much you phone, you want to loose some weight, and you want to graduated from high school.

Today in day many people used their phone a lot and sometimes they don't do things because they spend most of their time on their phones. For example, you get home from school and you have to do some homework, but you don't want to do it yet because you just got home from school, and you tell your self that you will relax for a few hours, and then you will start to do your homework. You ate dinner and everything you go to your room and one of your friends ask you if you want to play videos game? you tell your self I will play a little bit and then I will start to do my homework. Two hours pass by and you are still playing videos games. You tell your friend I must stop playing because I have to start doing my homework and your friend tells you don't go, we ask someone to give us copy, and you say yes, because you want to continue do keep playing. When you get to school you don't have any body to ask to give you copy. It was your choice to keep playing. That day you make a plant you put a timer and when that timer stop you will stop doing what you are doing. It work because when you time your self you can do more than one thing, you could also have more time to just play but the good thing is you have finish all you things.

For new year resolution you say that you will loose some weight this year. Your family laugh at you because you had said that almost every year and you have not do it. Sometimes is good to just tell your self to do things and don't tell anyone because some people don't want others to get things because they want to get it first and if they don't get it. Those kind of people don't want others do get it also. If you want to loose weight just do it and don't tell any body because you don't know what others want for you. It's better to do things in secret because at the end you are the one you are doing it and no body is helping you. The things that you do are for you not for everyone. When you have your things you can tell to your closer people and some of them may be happy for you and some may not, but that doesn't have to worry you because you have already do your thing and they can't do nothing to take that away from you. Your family may see you that you say things but you don't do it. You have to show them that you can do things that you say. You may feel sad because of what people say and you just have that in your mint. That is why not good to tell everyone of what you want to do because they may be jealous and they don't want you to be in a very good shape. Just go and workout and when they see you again they will say wow you look different what did you did to look great; they will not see you as a lair because you show them that you can do things. It can take time to see the different but you are doing it.

When you are in school you will have friends that are good for you and also those that are not. When you are in high school you want to pass all your classes so you can make your parents proud and they can be happy; but their will be some friends that will tell you to go out and have fun etc. In school their will be students that care about classes and their will be that they don't care. You want to be with those friends that help each other to have good grades. Their will be friends that don't like you and want to get you in some trouble, and they will want you to don't have good grade and be like them. You want to be with friends that support each other. Also you don't want to be that kind of person that say you have good grade and you don't have those good grades and you just are copying others and when it's test time you don't know what to do because you didn't do the work by your self. To get things that you want; you have to work for it. It's better to have friends that help each other and that also that help you to do your work and can be easy for you to also help others.

People may disagree with this because they have good people around them and that they help each other. They may say this because they haven't go through things like; one of your friends don't like you and they don't want you to have the things you want. Sometimes is better to do things and don't tell everyone because you don't know what people really want for you or what they think of the things you want. In this world are people that they don't care what you, they will agreed with what you do and if you felt they always be with you, their is those that they don't want you and others to be happy. The best thing to do is just do things and when you have it tell to everyone that you want because when you already have it they can just talk bad things of you and you don't stay in front of them as a looser because you didn't they don't know how you did it. Us human been we always have the thing inside of us that always make us jealous for what others have. For example, If one of your friends have a news phone you will get a little bit jealous because you also want to have that phone. Every single person in this world has when through that. That's why people don't trust each others.

It's better to do things that no body know because if you felt or don't get what you want, their will not be people that knew. You didn't get it and they will not be talking bad things of you or look at you as a looser that you can't do anything. You will be the only one that will know and if you want to tell them you can it will be your choice. You want to do things because you want to be proud of yourself and that is the only thing it counts.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.1610732,2.948838,3.32548,3.0863254,2.8124497,3.0550132,3.108822,3.46871,3.4180233,3.0517385,3.1325676,3.1301837,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,1245,48,0.2032128514056224,25.9375,4,7,"{'lair', 'looser', 'wow', 'timer', 'copying', 'homework', 'videos'}"
